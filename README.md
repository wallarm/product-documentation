# Wallarm Overview

The Wallarm platform is uniquely suited to protect your cloud applications and APIs. Its hybrid architecture safeguards your resources by offering:

* Protection from hacker attacks.
* Automatic detection of [vulnerabilities](../glossary-en.md#vulnerability).

Wallarm does the following:

- _Discovers_

	Discovers your company's hosts, domains, and services accessible from the outside by combining deep scanning and accessing data from external
	sources.

- _Analyzes_

    Applies machine learning to reconstruct the application logic and API schema based on the resource's traffic.

    Creates dynamic blocking rules based on abnormal data patterns.

- _Protects_

    Blocks unauthorized access, evaluates attacks, and alerts on highâ€‘risk attempts targeted at the validated vulnerabilities. Applies virtual patches.
	
- _Verifies_

    Analyzes and actively replays the applications' input/output payloads to determine if an exploit is possible.
