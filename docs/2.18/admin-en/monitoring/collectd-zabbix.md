#   Exporting Metrics to Zabbix via the `collectd-nagios` Utility

This document provides an example of exporting filter node metrics to the [Zabbix][link-zabbix] monitoring system using the [`collectd-nagios`][link-collectd-nagios] utility.

##  Example Workflow

--8<-- "../include/monitoring/metric-example.md"


![Example workflow][img-zabbix-scheme]

The following deployment scheme is used in this document:
*   The Wallarm filter node is deployed on a host accessible via the `10.0.30.5` IP address and the `node.example.local` fully qualified domain name.
    
    The host has the [Zabbix agent][link-zabbix-agent] 4.0 LTS deployed that

    *   Downloads the filter node metrics using the `collectd-nagios` utility.
    *   Listens to incoming connections on the `10050/TCP` port (thus [passive checks][link-zabbix-passive] will take place with the use of Zabbix Appliance).
    *   Passes metric values to Zabbix Appliance. 
    
*   On a dedicated host with the `10.0.30.30` IP address (hereinafter referred to as the Docker host), the [Zabbix Appliance][link-zabbix-app] 4.0 LTS is deployed in the form of a Docker container.
    
    The Zabbix Appliance includes
    
    *   A Zabbix server that periodically polls the Zabbix agent installed on the filter node host to get information about changes to any monitored metrics).
    *   The Zabbix server management web interface, available on the `80/TCP` port.

    
    
##  Configuring Metrics Export to Zabbix


!!! info "Prerequisites"
    It is assumed that

    *   The `collectd` service has been configured for working via a Unix domain socket (see [here][doc-unixsock] for details).
    *   [Docker Community Edition][link-docker-ce] is already installed on the `10.0.30.30` Docker host.
    *   The `node.example.local` filter node is already deployed, configured, available for further configuration (for example, via the SSH protocol), and working.


### Deploying Zabbix

To deploy the Zabbix Appliance 4.0 LTS, execute the following command on the Docker host:

``` bash
docker run --name zabbix-appliance -p 80:80 -d zabbix/zabbix-appliance:alpine-4.0-latest
```

Now you have a working Zabbix monitoring system.

### Deploying the Zabbix Agent

Install the Zabbix Agent 4.0 LTS on a host with the filter node:
1.  Connect to the filter node (for example, using the SSH protocol). Make sure you are running as `root` or another account with superuser privileges.
2.  Connect the Zabbix repositories (use the “Install Zabbix repository” entry of the [instructions][link-zabbix-repo] for your operating system).
3.  Install the Zabbix agent by executing the appropriate command:

    --8<-- "../include/monitoring/install-zabbix-agent.md"

4.  Configure the Zabbix Agent to work with the Zabbix Appliance. To do this, make the following changes to the `/etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.conf` configuration file:
   
    ```
    Server=10.0.30.30			    # Zabbix IP address
    Hostname=node.example.local		# FQDN of the host with the filter node
    ```
    
### Configuring Metrics Collection Using the Zabbix Agent

Connect to the filter node (for example, using the SSH protocol) and configure the collection of metrics using the Zabbix agent. To do this, perform the following steps on the host with the filter node:

####    1.  Install the `collectd_nagios` utility
    
Execute the appropriate command:

--8<-- "../include/monitoring/install-collectd-utils.md"


####    2.  Configure the `collectd-nagios` utility to run with elevated privileges on behalf of the `zabbix` user
   
Use the [`visudo`][link-visudo] utility to add the following line to the `/etc/sudoers` file:
    
```
zabbix ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/collectd-nagios
```
    
This allows the `zabbix` user to run the `collectd-nagios` utility with superuser privileges using the `sudo` utility without the need to provide a password.


!!! info "Running `collectd-nagios` with superuser privileges"
    The utility must be run with superuser privileges because it uses the `collectd` Unix domain socket to receive data. Only a superuser can access this socket.
    
    As an alternative to adding the `zabbix` user to the `sudoers` list, you can configure the Zabbix agent to run as `root` (this may pose a security risk, so this is not recommended). This can be achieved by enabling the [`AllowRoot`][link-allowroot] option in the agent configuration file.
        
####    3.  Make sure that the `zabbix` user can receive metric values from `collectd`
    
Run the following test command on the filter node:
    
``` bash
sudo -u zabbix sudo /usr/bin/collectd-nagios -s /var/run/collectd-unixsock -n curl_json-wallarm_nginx/gauge-attacks -H node.example.local
```

This command invokes the `zabbix` user to get the value of the [`curl_json-wallarm_nginx/gauge-attacks`][link-metric] metric for the `node.example.local` host with the filter node.
    
**Example of the command output:**

```
OKAY: 0 critical, 0 warning, 1 okay | value=0.000000;;;;
```
    
####    4.  Add custom parameters to the Zabbix agent configuration file on the filter node host to get the metrics you need
    
For example, to create a custom parameter `wallarm_nginx-gauge-attacks` that corresponds to the `curl_json-wallarm_nginx/gauge-attacks` metric for a filter node with the fully qualified domain name `node.example.local`, add the following line to the configuration file:
   
```
UserParameter=wallarm_nginx-gauge-attacks, sudo /usr/bin/collectd-nagios -s /var/run/collectd-unixsock -n curl_json-wallarm_nginx/gauge-attacks -H node.example.local | sed -n "s/.*value\=\(.*\);;;;.*/\1/p"
```
!!! info "Extracting a metric value"
    To extract the value of a metric that goes after `value=` in the output of the `collectd-nagios` utility (e.g., `OKAY: 0 critical, 0 warning, 1 okay | value=0.000000;;;;`), this output is piped to the `sed` utility that executes the `sed` script to strip off unnecessary characters.
    
    See the [`sed` documentation][link-sed-docs] for more information on the syntax of its scripts.

####    5.  After all the necessary commands have been added to the Zabbix agent configuration file, restart the agent

--8<-- "../include/monitoring/zabbix-agent-restart-2.16.md"

##  Setup Complete

Now you can monitor user parameters related to Wallarm-specific metrics with Zabbix.
