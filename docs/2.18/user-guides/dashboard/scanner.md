# Scanner Dashboard

The scanner dashboard shows statistics on vulnerabilities detected in the [scope][doc-scanner-scope]:

* The number of vulnerabilities of all risk levels detected over the selected period. Clicking the counter redirects to the [**Events** tab][doc-events-tab] with a list of active vulnerabilities of the selected risk level
* The number of active vulnerabilities of all risk levels at the end of the selected period
* Changes in the number of vulnerabilities of all risk levels for the selected period

You can filter data on the Scanner dashboard by time period. By default, the dashboard displays the data for one month prior to the current date.
