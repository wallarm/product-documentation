# Detecting vulnerabilities

Due to negligence or inadequate information when building or implementing an application, it can be vulnerable to attacks. From this article, you will learn how the Wallarm platform detects application vulnerabilities enabling you to enhance system security.

## What is a vulnerability?

A vulnerability is an error made due to negligence or inadequate information when building or implementing an application. A vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to cross privilege boundaries (i.e. perform unauthorized actions) within an application.

## Vulnerability detection methods

When scanning the application for active vulnerabilities, Wallarm sends requests with attack signs to the protected application address and analyzes application responses. If the response matches one or more pre‑defined vulnerability signs, Wallarm records active vulnerability.

For example: if the response to the request sent to read the `/etc/passwd` contents returns the `/etc/passwd` contents, protected application is vulnerable to the Path Traversal attacks. Wallarm will record the vulnerability with an appropriate type.

To detect vulnerabilities in the application, Wallarm sends requests with attack signs using the following methods:

* **Passive detection**: the vulnerability was found due to the security incident that occurred.
* **Active threat verification**: lets you turn attackers into penetration testers and discover possible security issues from their activity as they probe your apps/APIs for vulnerabilities. This module finds possible vulnerabilities by probing application endpoints using real attack data from the traffic. By default this method is disabled.
* **Vulnerability Scanner**: company's exposed assets are scanned for typical vulnerabilities.

### Passive detection

With passive detection, Wallarm detects a vulnerability due to the security incident that occurred. If an application vulnerability has been exploited during an attack, Wallarm records the security incident and the exploited vulnerability.

Passive vulnerability detection is enabled by default.

### Active threat verification

#### How it works

--8<-- "../include/how-attack-rechecker-works.md"

!!! warning "Active threat verification if hits are grouped by IP"
    If an attack is hits [grouped](protecting-against-attacks.md#attack) by originating IPs, active verification of this attack is unavailable.

#### Potential risks from the "Active threat verification" module

* In rare cases when a legitimate request is detected by Wallarm as an attack, the request will be replayed by the **Active threat verification** module. If the request is not idempotent (for example, an authenticated request creating a new object in the application), then the requests generated by the module for threat verification may create many new unwanted objects in the client account or perform other unexpected operations.

    To minimize the risk of the described situation, the **Active threat verification** module will automatically strip the following HTTP headers from the replayed requests:

    * `Cookie`
    * `Authorization: Basic`
    * `Viewstate`
* In cases when the application uses a non-standard authentication method or does not require authenticating the requests, the **Active threat verification** module may replay any request from the traffic and harm the system. For example: repeat 100 and more money transactions or orders. To minimize the risk of the described situation, it is recommended to [use testing or staging environments for attack replaying](../admin-en/attack-rechecker-best-practices.md#optional-configure-attack-rechecker-request-rewriting-rules-run-tests-against-a-copy-of-the-application) and [mask non-standard request authentication parameters](../admin-en/attack-rechecker-best-practices.md#configure-proper-data-masking-rules).

#### Configuration

The module **Active threat verification** is disabled by default. It should be enabled and properly configured to work correctly. Please learn the **Active threat verification** configuration options and best practices for these options setup from [this document](../admin-en/attack-rechecker-best-practices.md).

### Vulnerability Scanner

#### How it works

Vulnerability Scanner checks all company's exposed assets for typical vulnerabilities. Scanner sends requests to application addresses from fixed IP addresses and adds the header `X-Wallarm-Scanner-Info` to the requests.

#### Configuration

* Scanner can be [enabled or disabled](../user-guides/scanner/configure-scanner-modules.md) in the Wallarm Console → **Scanner** section. By default, Scanner is enabled	
* The list of [vulnerabilities that can be detected](../user-guides/scanner/configure-scanner-modules.md) by Scanner can be configured in the Wallarm Console → **Scanner** section. By default, Vulnerability Scanner detects all available vulnerabilities	
* The [limit of requests sent from Scanner](../user-guides/scanner/configure-scanner.md#scanners-rps-limits) can be configured in the Wallarm Console → **Scanner** section	
* If the filtering node operates in the `block` mode, it is required to [disable blocking of IP addresses](../admin-en/scanner-ips-allowlisting.md) from which Scanner sends requests

## False positives

**False positive** occurs when attack signs are detected in the legitimate request or when legitimate entity is qualified as a vulnerability. [More details on false positives in attack detection →](protecting-against-attacks.md#false-positives)

False positives in vulnerability scanning may occur due to the protected application specificities. Similar responses to similar requests may indicate an active vulnerability in one protected application and be expected behavior of another protected application.

If a false positive for a vulnerability is detected, you can add an appropriate mark to the vulnerability in Wallarm Console. A vulnerability marked as a false positive will be switched to an appropriate status and will not be checked by the **Active threat verification** module. [More about managing false positives via Wallarm Console →](../user-guides/vulnerabilities/false-vuln.md)

If the detected vulnerability exists in the protected application but cannot be fixed, we recommend setting up the [**Create a virtual patch**](../user-guides/rules/vpatch-rule.md) rule. This rule will allow blocking attacks exploiting the detected type of vulnerability and will eliminate the risk of an incident.

## Managing discovered vulnerabilities

All detected vulnerabilities are displayed in the Wallarm Console → **Vulnerabilities** section. You can manage vulnerabilities through the interface as follows:

* View and analyze vulnerabilities
* Run vulnerability status verification: still active or fixed on the application side
* Close vulnerabilities or mark them as false positives

For more information on managing vulnerabilities, see the instructions on [working with vulnerabilities](../user-guides/vulnerabilities/check-vuln.md).

## Notifications about discovered vulnerabilities

Wallarm can send you notifications on discovered vulnerabilities. It allows you to be aware of newly discovered vulnerabilities of your applications and respond to them promptly. Responding to vulnerabilities includes fixing them on the application side, reporting false positives and applying virtual patches.

To configure notifications:

1. Create the [native integration](../user-guides/settings/integrations/integrations-intro.md) with the system to send notifications (e.g. PagerDuty, Opsgenie, Splunk, Slack, Telegram).
2. In the integration card, select the **Vulnerabilities detected** in the list of available events.

Example of the Splunk notification about detected vulnerability:

```json
{
    summary:"[Test message] [Test partner(US)] New vulnerability detected",
    description:"Notification type: vuln

                New vulnerability was detected in your system.

```
