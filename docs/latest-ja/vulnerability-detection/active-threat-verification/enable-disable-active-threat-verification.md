# Enabling Active Threat Verification Globally or for Specific Endpoints <a href="../../../about-wallarm/subscription-plans/#subscription-plans"><img src="../../../images/api-security-tag.svg" style="border: none;"></a>

[Wallarm's Active Threat Verification](overview.md) module can be enabled either globally, affecting all endpoints where the filtering node is set up, or individually for specific endpoints. This article provides instructions on managing the module's behavior.

## Enabling the module globally

Active Threat Verification is disabled by default. To enable it globally:

1. Ensure you have an active **Advanced API Security** [subscription plan](../../about-wallarm/subscription-plans.md#subscription-plans). The module is only available under this plan.

    If you are on a different plan, please contact our [sales team](mailto:sales@wallarm.com) to transition to the required one.
1. Proceed to Wallarm Console → **Vulnerabilities** → **Configure** by following the link for the [US Cloud](https://us1.my.wallarm.com/vulnerabilities/active?configure=true) or [EU Cloud](https://my.wallarm.com/vulnerabilities/active?configure=true), and toggle on the **Active threat verification** switch.

This action enables the module for all resources where the filtering node is configured.

## Controlling the module mode for specific endpoints

Once the module is [globally enabled](#enabling-the-module-globally), you can customize its behavior for specific endpoints using the corresponding rule. Here is how:

1. Proceed to Wallarm Console → **Rules** → create the **Set mode of active threat verification** rule.
1. Fill in the rule creation form following the instructions:

    * **If request is** [specifies](../../user-guides/rules/rules.md#rule-branches) the endpoints to apply the rule to.
    * **Disable / Enable** sets the mode of the module for attacks sent to the specified endpoints.

    Use the **Enable** setting to make exceptions for a rule that disables the module (e.g., enabling for `https://example.com/module/user/create` while it is disabled for `https://example.com/module/user/*`).
1. Wait for the [custom ruleset compilation to complete](../../user-guides/rules/rules.md).

### Enabling the module for specific endpoints

To enable the module for specific endpoints only:

1. Enable the module globally in Wallarm Console → **Vulnerabilities** → **Configure**.
1. Disable the module for all endpoints by creating the **Set mode of active threat verification** rule and leaving the **If request is** section empty.
1. Create **Set mode of active threat verification** rules to enable the module for specific hosts, applications, or endpoints by describing them in the **If request is rule** section.

Here is how the rule looks when disabling the module for all endpoints:

If the rule mentioned above is already active, the following rule would enable the module for `https://example.com/module/user/create`:

Alternatively, you can disable the module by applying a rule for the URL and then enable it for specific endpoints related to that URL.

### Disabling the module for specific endpoints

For endpoints without a staging environment, especially those that are non-idempotent or lack an authentication mechanism, it is recommended to disable attack replay. Without these safeguards, the module might inadvertently repeat harmful actions, such as processing monetary transactions multiple times or repeatedly creating new accounts.

To disable the module for specific endpoints:

1. Enable the module globally in Wallarm Console → **Vulnerabilities** → **Configure**.
1. Disable the module for the required endpoints using the **Set mode of active threat verification** rule. Describe these endpoints in the **If request is** rule section.

Consider a non-idempotent endpoint like POST `https://example.com/api/purchase` on an online shopping platform that handles actions such as deducting inventory and charging user accounts. If this action is accidentally repeated by the module, it could lead to such consequences as multiple charges for a single item. Therefore, for such endpoints in a production environment, it is recommended to disable attack replay. For such an endpoint, the rule would look like this:
