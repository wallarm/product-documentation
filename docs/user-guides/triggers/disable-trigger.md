# Disabling Triggers

To stop sending notifications and reactions to events temporarily, you can disable the trigger. To disable the trigger permanently, you can [delete](delete-trigger.md) the trigger.

Triggers are disabled in your Wallarm account > the **Triggers** section via the **Disable** button. The section is available only for users with the **Administrator** [role](../settings/users.md).
