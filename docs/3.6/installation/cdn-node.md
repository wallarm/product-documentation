# Deploying Wallarm CDN node

Wallarm CDN node operating as a reverse proxy mitigates malicious traffic without placing any third‑party components in the application's infrastructure.

!!! info "CDN nodes under Free tier"
    Deployment of the CDN node type is not supported under the [Free tier plan](../about-wallarm/subscription-plans.md#free-tier-subscription-plan).

## How CDN node works

--8<-- "../include/waf/installation/cdn-node/how-cdn-node-works.md"

## Requirements

--8<-- "../include/waf/installation/cdn-node/cdn-node-deployment-requirements.md"

## CDN node deployment

1. Open Wallarm Console → **Nodes** → **CDN** → **Create node**.
1. Input the domain address to be protected, e.g. `ple.example.com`.

    The specified address must be the third-level (or lower) domain and not contain the scheme and slashes.
1. Make sure Wallarm correctly identifies the origin address associated with the specified domain. Otherwise, please change the automatically discovered origin address.

    ![CDN node creation modal][cdn-node-creation-modal]

    !!! warning "Dynamic update of origin address"
        If your hosting provider dynamically updates the origin IP address or domain associated with the protected resource, please keep the origin address specified in the CDN node configuration up to date. Wallarm Console enables you to [change the origin address][update-origin-ip-docs] at any time.

        Otherwise, requests will not reach the protected resource since the CDN node will try to proxy them to an incorrect origin address.
1. Wait for the CDN node registration to finish.

    Once the CDN node registration is finished, the CDN node status will be changed to **Requires CNAME**.
1. Add the CNAME record generated by Wallarm to the DNS records of the protected domain.

    If the CNAME record is already configured for the domain, please replace its value with the one generated by Wallarm.

    ![CDN node creation modal][cname-required-modal]

    Depending on your DNS provider, changes to DNS records can take up to 24 hours to propagate and take effect on the Internet. Once the new CNAME record is propagated, the Wallarm CDN node will proxy all incoming requests to the protected resource and block malicious ones.
1. If required, upload the custom SSL/TLS certificate.

    Wallarm will generate the Let's Encrypt certificate for the CDN node domain by default.
1. Once DNS record changes propagated, send test attack to the protected domain:

    ```bash
    curl http://<PROTECTED_DOMAIN>/?id='or+1=1--a-<script>prompt(1)</script>'
    ```

    * If originating IP address is [graylisted][graylist-docs], the node will both block the attack (the HTTP response code is 403) and record it.
    * If originating IP address is not [graylisted][graylist-docs], the node will only record detected attacks. You can check that attacks have been registered in Wallarm Console → **Events**:
