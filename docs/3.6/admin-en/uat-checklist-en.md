## Wallarm Node Detects Attacks

1. Send a malicious request to your resource:

   ```
   http://<resource_URL>/etc/passwd
   ```

2. Run the following command to check if the attack count increased:

   ```
   curl http://127.0.0.8/wallarm-status
   ```

See also [Checking the filter node operation](installation-check-operation-en.md)

## You Can Log into the Wallarm Interface

1.  Proceed to the link that corresponds to the cloud you are using: 
    *   If you are using the US cloud, proceed to the <https://us1.my.wallarm.com> link.
    *   If you are using the EU cloud, proceed to the <https://my.wallarm.com/> link.
2.  See if you can log in successfully.

See also the [Threat Prevention Dashboard overview](../user-guides/dashboards/threat-prevention.md).

## Wallarm Interface Shows Requests per Second

1. Send a request to your resource:

   ```
   curl http://<resource_URL>
   ```

   Or send several requests with a bash script:

   ```
   for (( i=0 ; $i<10 ; i++ )) ;
   do 
      curl http://<resource_URL> ;
   done
   ```

   This example is for 10 requests.

2. Check if the Wallarm interface shows detected requests per second.

See also the [Threat Prevention Dashboard](../user-guides/dashboards/threat-prevention.md).

## Wallarm Marks Requests as False and Stops Blocking them

1. Expand an attack on the *Attacks* tab. 
2. Select a hit and click *False*.
3. Wait for around 3 minutes.
4. Resend the request and check if Wallarm detects it as an attack and blocks it.

See also [Working with false attacks](../user-guides/events/false-attack.md).

## Wallarm Detects Vulnerabilities and Creates Security Incidents

1. Ensure you have an open vulnerability on your resource.
2. Send a malicious request to exploit the vulnerability.
3. Check if there is an incident detected in the Wallarm interface.

See also [Checking attacks and incidents](../user-guides/events/check-attack.md).

## Wallarm Detects Perimeter

1. On the *Scanner* tab, add your resource's domain.
2. Check if Wallarm discovers all resources associated with the added domain.

See also [Working with the scanner](../user-guides/scanner.md).

## IP allowlisting, denylisting, and graylisting work

1. Learn[ core logic of IP lists](../user-guides/ip-lists/overview.md).
2. Add IP addresses to the [allowlist](../user-guides/ip-lists/allowlist.md), [denylist](../user-guides/ip-lists/denylist.md), and [graylist](../user-guides/ip-lists/graylist.md).
3. Check that the filtering node correctly processes requests originated from IPs added to the lists.

## Users Can Be Configured and Have Proper Access Rights

1. Ensure you have the *Administrator* role in the Wallarm system.
2. Create, change role, disable, and delete a user as described in [Configuring users](../user-guides/settings/users.md).

See also [Configuring users](../user-guides/settings/users.md).

## User Activity Log Has Records

1. Go to *Settings* â€“> *Users*.
2. Check that *User Activity Log* has records.

See also [User activity log](../user-guides/settings/audit-log.md).

## Reporting Works

1. On the *Attacks* tab, put in a search query.
2. Click the report button on the right.
3. Put in your email and click the report button again.
5. Check if you receive the report.

See also [Creating a custom report](../user-guides/search-and-filters/custom-report.md).
