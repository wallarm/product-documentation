# Best Practices for Active Threat Verification Configuration

Wallarm's Active Threat Verification turns attackers into your own penetration testers. It analyzes initial attack attempts, then explores other ways the same attack could be exploited. For the module to operate securely, please learn its configuration best practices from this article.

## Know how to control Active Threat Verification

The global on/off switch of the Active Threat Verification module is located in Wallarm Console → **Vulnerabilities** → **Configure**. By default, this module is disabled.

## Run tests against a copy of the application

Testing on a production environment with real data can lead to downtime or data breaches. By testing in a non‑production setting like staging or development, you can assess vulnerabilities using similar data without such risks, ensuring system safety and early vulnerability detection.

## Generate authentication data for active threat verification

Your application's APIs might require authentication. However, since the module strips this data before replaying attacks, vulnerabilities may go undetected. To address this, consider creating specific authentication parameters for active threat verification when this data is passed in request headers. This approach not only grants the necessary access but also lets you control and secure the replay process.

## Mask sensitive data

By default, the standard authentication headers `Cookie`, `Authorization: Basic`, and `Viewstate` are automatically omitted when replaying attacks, ensuring the tests are safe.

For applications using non-standard authentication methods, such as custom HTTP headers or JSON attributes, it is recommended to set up a [data masking rule](../../user-guides/rules/sensitive-data-rule.md). This ensures that such details are not forwarded to Wallarm Cloud, keeping **Active Threat Verification** requests safe from potential unauthorized actions.

## Disable the module for specific endpoints

For endpoints that lack a staging environment and especially those that are non-idempotent or without an authentication mechanism, it is recommended to disable attack replay. Without these protections, the module might accidentally repeat harmful actions, such as processing monetary transactions multiple times or repeatedly registering new accounts.

## Configure notification and escalation rules for detected vulnerabilities

Wallarm provides [integrations with third-party messaging and incident management services](../../user-guides/settings/integrations/integrations-intro.md) like Slack, Telegram, PagerDuty, Opsgenie and others. It is highly recommended to configure your Wallarm Cloud instance to use the integrations to dispatch notifications about discovered security vulnerabilities to your information security team.
