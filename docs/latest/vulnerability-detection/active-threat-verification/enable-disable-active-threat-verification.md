# Enabling and Disabling Active Threat Verification <a href="../../../about-wallarm/subscription-plans/#subscription-plans"><img src="../../../images/api-security-tag.svg" style="border: none;"></a>

This article explains how to control Wallarm's [Active Threat Verification](overview.md) mode for endpoints.

## Enabling the module globally

Active threat verification is disabled by default. To enable:

1. Proceed to Wallarm Console → **Vulnerabilities** → **Configure**.
1. Toggle on the **Active threat verification** switch.

This action enables the module for all resources where the filtering node is configured.

## Disabling the module for specific endpoints

For endpoints that lack a staging environment and especially those that are non-idempotent or without an authentication mechanism, it is recommended to disable attack replay. Without these protections, the module might accidentally repeat harmful actions, such as processing monetary transactions multiple times or repeatedly registering new accounts.

You can disable attack replaying for such endpoints using the corresponding rule:

1. Proceed to Wallarm Console → **Rules** → create the rule **Set mode of active threat verification**.
1. Fill in the rule creation form following the instructions:

    * **Condition** [specifies](../../user-guides/rules/add-rule.md#branch-description) the endpoints to apply the rule to.
    * **Disable / Enable** sets the mode of the module for attacks sent to the specified endpoints.

    Use the **Enable** setting to make exceptions for a rule that disables the module (e.g., enabling for `https://example.com/module/user/create` while it is disabled for `https://example.com/module/user/*`).
1. Wait for the [custom ruleset compilation to complete](../../user-guides/rules/compiling.md).

For instance, here is how the rule looks when disabling the **Active Threat Verification** for `https://example.com/module/user/*`:

If the rule mentioned above is already active, the following rule would enable the module for `https://example.com/module/user/create`:

<!-- ATC on/off for all requests that are idempotent or not.

Describe the following case in the documentation on how customer can configure Active Threat Verification - if the customer needs Active Threat Verification to be applied not to all, but to just a few hosts/applications, he can do the following:

enable Active Verification feature

create a rule to disable Active Verification everywhere

create rules to enable Active Verification on specific hosts/applications -->
