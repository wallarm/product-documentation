# API Security Testing via Postman

Run safe, passive security tests on your Postman collections and OpenAPI specs to detect authentication gaps, data leaks, and design-level flaws. No attack payloads, no traffic replay, no production risk—tests typically complete in about 2–3 minutes.

## When to use

* You store and test your APIs in Postman and want to check them for security issues.
* You want to ask in natural language (e.g., "test my collection") and get immediate results with recommendations directly in Postman's AI mode—no separate tools or workflows.

## What it finds

API Security Testing looks for issues such as:

* API key and secret leaks
* Missing or weak authentication
* Over-permissive endpoints
* Schema violations and drift
* Sensitive data exposure
* Basic BOLA / BOPLA indicators

Findings are summarized with explanations and remediation guidance, designed for developers rather than security specialists.

## Access via Postman

You can access API Security Testing via **Wallarm Rogue MCP** Wallarm's MCP server, which is easily accessible via Postman. Security checks run conversationally inside [Postman Agent Mode](https://learning.postman.com/docs/agent-mode/get-started)—no separate tools, proxies, or extra configuration. Scenario:

1. In Postman, you add **Wallarm Rogue MCP** MCP server to your Workspace.
1. With Postman's AI Agent, you ask in natural language to test your collection (e.g., *"Please, test the collection for security issues with Wallarm."*).
1. The Agent runs the tests (about 2–3 minutes) and responds with a report covering:

    * What security issues were found in your APIs
    * How to fix them

1. Test results are also [sent to Wallarm Cloud](exploring.md#view-test-runs-in-wallarm-console-secondary).

To get started, proceed to [Setup](setup.md).

## Other tools

Besides API Security Testing via Postman, **Wallarm Rogue MCP** Wallarm's MCP server provides other tools, such as [Rogue MCP Inspection](../../agentic-ai/rogue-mcp-inspection.md)—auditing local MCP servers for supply-chain risks and excessive privileges.
