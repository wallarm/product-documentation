# API Security Testing via Postman

Run safe, passive security tests on your Postman collections and OpenAPI specs to detect authentication gaps, data leaks, and design-level flaws. No attack payloads, no traffic replay, no production risk—tests typically complete in about 2–3 minutes.

## When to use

* You store and test your APIs in Postman and want to check them for security issues.
* You want to ask in natural language (e.g., "test my collection") and get immediate results with recommendations directly in Postman's AI mode—no separate tools or workflows.

## What it finds

API Security Testing looks for issues such as:

* API key and secret leaks
* Missing or weak authentication
* Over-permissive endpoints
* Schema violations and drift
* Sensitive data exposure
* Basic BOLA / BOPLA indicators

Findings are summarized with explanations and remediation guidance, designed for developers rather than security specialists.

## API Security Testing via Postman vs Schema-Based Testing (Postman)

Wallarm also offers [Schema-Based Testing](../schema-based-testing/overview.md), which can use your Postman collection to run dynamic security tests (typically via Docker in CI/CD). Both options can use your Postman collections; choose based on how you work and how deep you need to go:

| | **API Security Testing via Postman** | **Schema-Based Testing** (Postman collection) |
|---|---|---|
| **Use when** | You want a quick, conversational check inside Postman—ask in natural language and get results in the Agent chat in a few minutes. | You want automated, comprehensive DAST in CI/CD; you already have functional tests in Postman and want them to drive security tests. |
| **How it runs** | Passive, design-level analysis; no attack payloads, no traffic replay. | Dynamic testing: sends real requests, uses your collection's functional tests as a blueprint to generate and run security tests. |
| **Depth** | Auth gaps, data leaks, over-permissive endpoints, schema issues, basic BOLA/BOPLA—summarized for developers. | OWASP API Top 10, business logic, access control, input validation (injections, RCE, etc.), environment misconfigurations. |
| **Where** | Inside Postman (Agent Mode); results in chat and in Wallarm Cloud. | Docker-based; runs in your pipeline or locally; results in Wallarm Console (Test runs, Security Issues). |

In short: use **API Security Testing via Postman** for fast, in-Postman checks with minimal setup; use Schema-Based Testing with a Postman collection when you need full DAST and pipeline integration.

## Access via Postman

You can access API Security Testing via **Wallarm Rogue MCP** Wallarm's MCP server, which is easily accessible via Postman. Security checks run conversationally inside [Postman Agent Mode](https://learning.postman.com/docs/agent-mode/get-started)—no separate tools, proxies, or extra configuration. Scenario:

1. In Postman, you add **Wallarm Rogue MCP** MCP server to your Workspace.
1. With Postman's AI Agent, you ask in natural language to test your collection (e.g., *"Please, test the collection for security issues with Wallarm."*).
1. The Agent runs the tests (about 2–3 minutes) and responds with a report covering:

    * What security issues were found in your APIs
    * How to fix them

1. Test results are also [sent to Wallarm Cloud](exploring.md#view-test-runs-in-wallarm-console-secondary).

To get started, proceed to [Setup](setup.md).

## Other tools

Besides API Security Testing via Postman, **Wallarm Rogue MCP** Wallarm's MCP server provides other tools, such as [Rogue MCP Inspection](../../agentic-ai/rogue-mcp-inspection.md)—auditing local MCP servers for supply-chain risks and excessive privileges.
