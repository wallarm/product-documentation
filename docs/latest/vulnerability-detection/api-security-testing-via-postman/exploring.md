# Exploring Results

You can view API Security Testing results in two ways: mainly in Postman's AI Mode (recommended), or in Wallarm Console for history and tracking.

## View results in Postman AI Mode (main)

Postman's AI Agent returns **LLM-assisted findings** directly in the conversation: summarized risks, plain-language explanations, and remediation guidance. The format is designed for developers, so you can understand and act on issues without being a security specialist.

Use the report in the Agent conversation to:

* See what was found (e.g., auth gaps, data leaks, over-permissive endpoints, schema issues, BOLA/BOPLA indicators).
* Read the suggested fixes and apply them in your API or collection.

This is the primary way to consume results—immediate, in context, with no need to leave Postman.

## View test runs in Wallarm Console (secondary)

Test results are also sent to Wallarm Cloud. To view the history of runs, credits consumed, and issue counts:

1. In Wallarm Console, go to **Security Testing** → **Rogue MCP** → the **Test runs** tab.
2. Use the table to see **Started/Finished** time, **Duration**, **Title**, **Credits** used, **Security issues** (count and severity), and **Status** (e.g. success or failed). Use **Search by test run title** and **Status** to filter.

3. If a run has found issues, click the **Security issues** count to open the **Security Issues** section filtered by that test run. There you can click any issue to see full detailed information on it (risk, type, OWASP, status, and remediation).
