# Setup

This article describes how to enable and configure [API Security Testing via Postman](overview.md).

## 1. Add  Wallarm's MCP server

1. In Postman, access its AI Agent.
1. In AI Agent panel, click **Configure** ("gear"), and select **Configure MCP servers**.
1. In displayed **MCP Servers** tab, click **Add** ("plus") and do one of the following:

    * Select **Wallarm Rogue MCP** from the list of the featured MCP servers
    * Or just click Edit config and save the following to it:

        ```json
        {
            "mcpServers": {
                "Wallarm Rogue MCP": {
                    "command": "npx",
                    "args": [
                        "-y",
                        "rogue-mcp@latest"
                    ],
                    "env": {
                        "WALLARM_API_TOKEN": "YOUR_WALLARM_API_TOKEN"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        ```

## 2. Get Wallarm credentials

To use the extended functions of Wallarm's MCP server, you need to obtain a `WALLARM_API_TOKEN` and paste it into the MCP server configuration in Postman. The flow depends on whether you are a new or existing Wallarm user.

**New users:**

1. Go to [roguemcp.wallarm.com](https://roguemcp.wallarm.com/).
1. Create a Wallarm account and obtain the **Rogue MCP** [subscription](../../about-wallarm/subscription-plans.md#rogue-mcp).
1. Copy the provided API token and paste it as the `WALLARM_API_TOKEN` value in your MCP server configuration in Postman.

**Existing users:**

1. Contact [Wallarm Support](https://support.wallarm.com) to get the **Rogue MCP** [subscription](../../about-wallarm/subscription-plans.md#rogue-mcp).
1. Once the subscription is active, go to Wallarm Console → **Settings** → [**API Tokens**](../../user-guides/settings/api-tokens.md) and create a token of the **Rogue MCP** type.
1. Copy the token and paste it as the `WALLARM_API_TOKEN` value in your MCP server configuration in Postman.

## 3. Ask to test the collection

With Wallarm's MCP server and credentials in place, use natural language in Postman Agent Mode to ask for a security test. For example: *"Please, test the collection for security issues with Wallarm."*

The Agent runs the tests (typically 2–3 minutes) and responds with a report; results are also sent to Wallarm Cloud. To interpret them, see [Exploring Results](exploring.md).
