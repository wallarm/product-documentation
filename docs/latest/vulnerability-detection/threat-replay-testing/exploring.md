# Exploring Threat Replay Testing Results

Once [Threat Replay Testing](overview.md) is enabled and configured, you can explore the performed tests and their results as described in this article.

## Tests and results

In Wallarm Console, go to **Threat Replay Testing** → the **Tests** tab to see the list of performed tests and their results (the [**Status**](#possible-statuses) column).

![TRT - Tests tab](../../images/vulnerability-detection/trt-tests.png)

You can:

* View the initial attack that triggered tests by clicking the redirect icon in the **Attack** column. The **Attacks** section will be displayed showing the initial attack.
* View the found vulnerability (if found) by clicking the redirect icon in the **Status** column.

## Possible statuses

Testing is performed:

* **No vulnerabilities found**: the testing did not find the attack's target being vulnerable to this attack type.
* **Vulnerabilities found**: the testing found that the attack's target is vulnerable to this attack type. The vulnerability is created and listed in the **Vulnerabilities** tab.

Technical statuses:

* **In-progress**: the attack is happening now; it will be verified when finished.
* **Error**: an attempt to verify an attack type that does not support verification:

    * [Brute-force][al-brute-force-attack]
    * [Forced browsing][al-forced-browsing]
    * [BOLA][al-bola]
    * Attacks with a request processing limit
    * Attacks for which the vulnerabilities have already been closed
    * Attacks that do not contain enough data for verification
    * [Attacks that consist of hits grouped by originating IPs](../../admin-en/configuration-guides/protecting-with-thresholds.md)

* **Skipped**: an attempt to verify an attack type has been skipped. Possible reasons:

    * Attacks sent via the gRPC or Protobuff protocol
    * Attacks sent via the HTTP protocol of the version different from 1.x
    * Attacks sent via the method different from one of the following: GET, POST, PUT, HEAD, PATCH, OPTIONS, DELETE, LOCK, UNLOCK, MOVE, TRACE
    * Failed to reach an address of an original request
    * Attack signs are in the `HOST` header
    * [Request element](../../user-guides/rules/request-processing.md) containing attack signs is different from one of the following: `uri` , `header`, `query`, `post`, `path`, `action_name`, `action_ext`

* **Scheduled**: the attack is queued for verification. To raise the priority of the attack verification in the queue, click the verification icon and then **Force verification**.
* **Forced**: the attack has a raised priority in the verification queue.
* **Could not connect to the server**: it is not possible to access the server at this time.

## Found vulnerabilities

In Wallarm Console, go to **Threat Replay Testing** → the **Vulnerabilities** tab to see the list of vulnerabilities found by Threat Replay Testing.

![TRT - Vulnerabilities tab](../../images/vulnerability-detection/trt-vulns.png)

You can:

* Search by vulnerabilities, domains or paths.
* Filter by risk level, attack type, vulnerability status and date it was discovered.
* Click vulnerability to see its detailed description.
* Modify vulnerability's risk level.
* Close or re-open vulnerability.
* Mark vulnerability as false.
