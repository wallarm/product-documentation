# Threat Replay Testing Setup

This article describes how to enable and configure Wallarm's [Threat Replay Testing](overview.md).

## Enable

Threat Replay Testing is disabled by default. To enable and run:

1. Ensure you have an active **Cloud Native WAAP** or **Advanced API Security** [subscription plan](../../about-wallarm/subscription-plans.md#waap-and-advanced-api-security).

    If you are on a different plan, please contact our [sales team](mailto:sales@wallarm.com) to transition to the required one.

1. Proceed to Wallarm Console → **Threat Replay Testing** by following the link for the [US Cloud](https://us1.my.wallarm.com/threat-replay-testing/tests) or [EU Cloud](https://my.wallarm.com/threat-replay-testing/tests), and toggle on the **Enable Threat Replay Testing** switch.
1. [Add](#ip-addresses) IP addresses of Threat Replay Testing to the whitelists.
1. Go to the **Test policies** tab and create [at least one policy](#configure-test-policies).

## IP addresses

It is recommended to add Threat Replay Testing IP addresses to the **whitelists** of your software or hardware facilities (besides Wallarm) that you use to automatically filter and block traffic. This will prevent Threat Replay Testing from being blocked by these facilities.

The lists of such addresses for US and EU Clouds is provided [here](../../admin-en/scanner-addresses.md).

## Configure test policies

When the attack on some endpoint is detected by the filtering node, it triggers [enabled](#enable) Threat Replay Testing to run tests to check whether this endpoint is vulnerable to this attack type.

Will these tests be run and how exactly, is defined by *test policies*, each defining:

* For which host the tests should be run.
* On which environment the tests should be run.
* For which attack type the tests should be run.
* How often the re-test should be run for this endpoint and attack type.
* Optionally, how the test request should be modified before executing on the test environment.

## How several test policies interact

Consider the following:

* No policies → no tests.
* No policies for this host / attack type → no tests.
* Several policies affecting the host → several separate tests.

About the time: if test was already performed for this endpoint and attack type and new attacks of this type on this endpoint occur, test will not be re-run before the **Period** is expired.

## Host and replay host

Use **Host affected by attack** and **Replay attack on host** fields to define for which host the tests should be run and on which environment theses tests should be run.

You can use regular expressions, including capturing groups and backreferences in both fields. Find below the demonstration of the most common scenarios.

### Scenario #1: recheck attacks on arbitrary subdomains on a specific host

Host affected by the attack: `.+\.wallarm\.com`
Replay attack on host:  `test.wallarm.com`

Result:

* Any attack on  `www.wallarm.com`  will be tested on `test.wallarm.com`.
* Any attack on `dev.wallarm.com` will be tested on `test.wallarm.com`.

### Scenario #2: substitution in the middle of the hostname

Host affected by the attack: `(.+)\.wallarm\.com`
Replay attack on host:   `\1.test-wallarm.com`

Result:

* Attack on `www.wallarm.com` will be tested on `www.test-wallarm.com`.
* Attack on `dev.wallarm.com` will be tested on `dev.test-wallarm.com`.

### Scenario #3: recheck any request on the same host

Host affected by the attack: `(.+)`
Replay attack on host: `\1`

Result: 

* Attack on `www.wallarm.com` will be tested on `www.wallarm.com`  
* Attack on `dev.wallarm.com` will be tested on `dev.wallarm.com`
             
### Scenario #4: recheck attack on specific host on a specific host

Host affected by the attack: `www\.wallarm\.com`
Replay attack on host:  `test.wallarm.com`

Result: 

* Attack on` www.wallarm.com` will be tested on `test.wallarm.com`  
* Attack on `dev.wallarm.com` will not be tested

## Rewrites

By default, Threat Replay Testing retains the original request data, except for [stripping specific authentication parameters](overview.md#test-request-security). You can use the **Rewrites** section of test policies to modify the original request elements before generating test attack set based on them. This can be particularly useful when replacing original authentication data with test data or conducting attack replays on alternative addresses.

!!! warning "Modification of any original request element"
    You can modify only headers (`header`) and paths (`uri`) of the original requests. Other request elements cannot be modified or added.

**Rewrite example**

The following is the rewrite to ensure attacks replayed on example.com carry the value `PHPSESSID=mntdtbgt87j3auaq60iori2i63; security=low` in the `COOKIE` header. The format of the header value is `{{'PHPSESSID=mntdtbgt87j3auaq60iori2i63; security=low'}}`.
