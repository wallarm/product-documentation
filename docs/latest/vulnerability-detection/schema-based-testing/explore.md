# Exploring Test Run Results <a href="../../../about-wallarm/subscription-plans/#core-subscription-plans"><img src="../../../images/security-testing-tag.svg" style="border: none;"></a>

Once [Schema-Based Testing](overview.md) is enabled, test policies are [configured](setup.md#configure-test-policies), and tests on their basis [are run](setup.md#docker-run), you can explore the test run results as described in this article.

## Test runs and results

In Wallarm Console, go to **Security Testing** → **Schema-Based** → **Test runs** to view all test runs and their results.

Here you can review security issues detected during the run, health checks, and the Docker output for the run:

<div>
  <script async src="https://js.storylane.io/js/v2/storylane.js"></script>
  <div class="sl-embed" style="position:relative;padding-bottom:calc(57.76% + 25px);width:100%;height:0;transform:scale(1)">
    <iframe loading="lazy" class="sl-demo" src="https://wallarm.storylane.io/demo/otjzzkttaywq?embed=inline" name="sl-embed" allow="fullscreen" allowfullscreen style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%!important;height:100%!important;border:1px solid rgba(63,95,172,0.35);box-shadow: 0px 0px 18px rgba(26, 19, 72, 0.15);border-radius:10px;box-sizing:border-box;"></iframe>
  </div>
</div>

## Test run details

You can obtain test run details from Wallarm Cloud and from you Docker container output.

### In Wallarm UI

Click test run to expand and see its detailed technical information:

![Schema-based security testing - test run details](../../images/vulnerability-detection/apitp-test-run-details.png)

You can check:

* Test run health: is specification/Postman collection valid and was the run successful.
* Errors and warnings (if any) occurred while running.
* Docker container output (with the **Copy to clipboard** capability).

Also you can:

* Download JSON report for your test run.
* Copy link to the test run details to share with colleagues.

### Docker container output

You can find test run results in your Docker container output directly, for example:

```

Sep  2 18:33:57.411 ERR Exiting with code 1 due to security issues meeting fail-severity threshold fail_severity=high count=16
```

In the example, pay your attention to exit with code 1 (failed tests) due to set [test run success criteria](setup.md#test-run-success-criteria).

## Downloading initial files

From the **Schema-Based Testing** page, you can download files that you used for creating OAS or Postman-based test policies:

* OAS: its specification.
* Postman: Postman collection file, Postman environment file(s) if were used

To download files:

1. In Wallarm Console, go to **API Security Testing** → **Schema-Based** → **Test policies** tab.
1. Hover your policy, and click the edit icon. Policy edit dialog is displayed.
1. In corresponding file field, click the download icon.
