# Exploring Test Run Results <a href="../../../about-wallarm/subscription-plans/#core-subscription-plans"><img src="../../../images/security-testing-tag.svg" style="border: none;"></a>

Once [Schema-Based Testing](overview.md) is enabled, test policies are [configured](setup.md#configure-test-policies), and tests on their basis [are run](setup.md#docker-run), you can explore the test run results as described in this article.

## Test runs and results

In Wallarm Console, go to **Security Testing** → **Schema-Based** → **Test runs** tab to see the list of run tests and their results (the **Requests** and **Security issues** columns).

![Schema-Based Testing - test runs](../../images/vulnerability-detection/sbt-test-runs.png)

You can view:

* When the test was run (start, end and duration)
* On which [test policy](setup.md#configure-test-policies) it was based
* What target URL (application) was tested
* What security issues were detected

In the **Security issues** column, click issues of specific risk level to go to the **Security issues** section and see these issues.

## Downloading initial files

From the **Schema-Based Testing** page, you can download files that you used for creating OAS or Postman-based test policies:

* OAS: its specification.
* Postman: Postman collection file, Postman environment file(s) if were used

Do download files:

1. In Wallarm Console, go to **API Security Testing** → **Schema-Based** → **Test policies** tab.
