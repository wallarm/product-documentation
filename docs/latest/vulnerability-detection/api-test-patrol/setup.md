# API Test Patrol Setup

This article describes how to enable and configure Wallarm's [API Test Patrol](overview.md).

## Enable

Wallarm's API Test Patrol is currently an **early access** feature under development - you can go through the currently available features.

API Test Patrol is disabled by default. To enable:

1. If in Wallarm Console you do not see the **API Test Patrol** section, contact the [Wallarm support team](https://support.wallarm.com/) to enable.
1. Go to the **API Test Patrol** → **Test policies** tab and create [at least one policy](#configure-test-policies).

## Configure test policies

Test policy defines:

* Target application
* It's OpenAPI specification
* It's base URL 
* Tests to run

Besides persistent parameters that are the same for any test run, each test policy includes parameters that can be re-defined during each next test run (**Run time** parameters). Re-defining the run time parameters can be useful for embedding of Docker into the CI/CD pipelines.

To configure test policy:

1. Go to Wallarm Console → **API Security Testing** → **API Test Patrol** → **Test policies**.
1. Click **Add policy**, set options and save.
