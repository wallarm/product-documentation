# API Test Patrol Setup

This article describes how to enable and configure Wallarm's [API Test Patrol](overview.md).

## Enable

API Test Patrol is disabled by default. To enable:

1. If in Wallarm Console you do not see the **API Security Testing** → **API Test Patrol** section, contact the [Wallarm support team](https://support.wallarm.com/) to enable.
1. Go to the **API Test Patrol** → **Test policies** tab and create [at least one policy](#configure-test-policies).

## Configure test policies

Test policy defines persistently:

* Application's **OpenAPI specification**
* Tests to run

Besides persistent parameters that are the same for any test run, each test policy may optionally include parameters that can be re-defined during each next test run (**Runtime parameters**). Re-defining the runtime parameters can be useful for embedding of Docker into the CI/CD pipelines:

* Application's **Target URL**

    (although can be redefined during each run, some initial value is required)

* Authentication parameters

To configure test policy:

1. Go to Wallarm Console → **API Security Testing** → **API Test Patrol** → **Test policies**.
1. Click **Add policy**, attach OpenApi specification file.
1. Select [test types](overview.md#test-types) to run.
1. Set **Target URL** (can be re-defined dynamically during each test run).
1. Optionally, add other **Runtime parameters**.

You can edit previously created policies: while clicking policy itself opens its Docker command info, you can click the edit button to access the edit dialog:

## Docker run

As test policy is [created](#configure-test-policies), it provides you with the Docker run command which allows you start tests for your application:

1. Go to Wallarm Console → **API Security Testing** → **API Test Patrol** → **Test policies**.
1. Click you policy. The policy's Docker command will be displayed.

1. Copy command and run it or embed into your CI/CD pipeline. This will run security tests selected in the policy for your application.

    Remember that you can re-define the policy's **Runtime parameters** on each run by adding the corresponding `-e` parameters to the Docker `run` command, for example:

    ```
    -e TARGET_URL="http://dvapi.st.wallarm.tools" 
    -e AUTH_HEADER="Authorization: Bearer <VALUE>"
    ```
    
1. View run statistics and [test run results](explore.md) on the **Test runs** tab.

## Deleting policies

You can delete a test policy. If you do so:

* Information on previous test runs will remain untouched
* You will not be able to run Docker's command based on the deleted policy
* If policy's Docker containers are running, they will continue to do so
* When policy's Docker containers stop, you will not be able to re-run them
