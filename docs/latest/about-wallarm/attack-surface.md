# API Attack Surface Management

Wallarm's **API Attack Surface Management** (**AASM**) is a set of capabilities that allows organizations to enumerate, assess, and manage the public attack surface presented by their APIs. With AASM, organizations can get a handle on the previously unknown risks that come with the growth in APIs for application delivery and integration, including API leaks.
