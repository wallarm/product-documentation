# API Attack Surface

Not knowing your company API endpoint portfolio introduces significant security risks, ranging from unauthorized access and data breaches to the potentially insufficient oversight of vulnerabilities.

Wallarm's **API Attack Surface** mitigates these risks being capable of:

* Analyzing your entire API surface and automatically finding all your publicly [exposed assets](../user-guides/scanner.md)

* Checking found APIs for [vulnerabilities](../about-wallarm/detecting-vulnerabilities.md)

    ![Vulnerabilities tab](../images/user-guides/vulnerabilities/check-vuln.png)

* Searching public sources for [leaked tokens](../about-wallarm/api-leaks.md) that may be relevant to these APIs and blocking the leaked tokens usage
