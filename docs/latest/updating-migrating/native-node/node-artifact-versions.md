# Native Node Artifact Versions and Changelog

This document lists available [versions](../versioning-policy.md) of the [Native Wallarm Node](../../installation/nginx-native-node-internals.md#native-node) 0.14.x+ in various form factors, helping you track releases and plan upgrades.

## All-in-one installer

The all-in-one installer for the Native Node is used for [connectors](../../installation/nginx-native-node-internals.md#connectors_1).

History of all-in-one installer updates simultaneously applies to it's x86_64 and ARM64 (beta) versions.

[How to upgrade](all-in-one.md)

### 0.18.0 (2025-09-17)

* Added support for the [Azure API Management connector](../../installation/connectors/azure-api-management.md)
* Added support for the [Apigee API Management connector](../../installation/connectors/apigee.md)

### 0.17.1 (2025-08-15)

* Fixed the stuffed credentials export to the Cloud
* Improved GraphQL parser
* Optimized the internal channel between the Node and wstore to increase throughput
    
    This prevents potential data loss when the Node ingests traffic faster than it can export it to postanalytics.
* Fixed an issue where serialized requests without a source IP address failed to be exported to postanalytics
* Bug fixes and internal improvements

### 0.16.3 (2025-08-05)

* Added support for the [Akamai connector](../../installation/connectors/akamai-edgeworkers.md)
* Fixed a silent failure when upgrading with the `--preserve` flag set to `true`

### 0.16.1 (2025-08-01)

* Introduced the [`drop_on_overload`](../../installation/native-node/all-in-one-conf.md#drop_on_overload) parameter to control dropping excess input under high load

    Enabled (`true`) by default.
* Added new [Prometheus metrics](../../admin-en/native-node-metrics.md):

    * `wallarm_gonode_application_info` with the general Native Node instance information, e.g.:
    
        ```bash
        wallarm_gonode_application_info{deployment_type="node-native-aio-installer",mode="connector-server",version="0.16.1"} 1
        ```
    
    * `wallarm_gonode_http_inspector_balancer_workers`
    * `wallarm_gonode_http_inspector_debug_container_len` now includes `aggregate="sum"` for `type="channel:in"`
    * `wallarm_gonode_http_inspector_errors_total` now includes a new `type="FlowTimeouts"`
* Improved stability in the internal `http_inspector` module

### 0.16.0 (2025-07-23)

* Added support for the [MuleSoft Flex Gateway connector](../../installation/connectors/mulesoft-flex.md)
* Introduced the [`input_filters`](../../installation/native-node/all-in-one-conf.md#input_filters) configuration section, allowing to define which requests should be inspected or bypassed by the Node
* Fixed memory leak
* In rules, the separator used in [**xml_tag**](../../user-guides/rules/request-processing.md#xml) values that combine a URI, namespace, and tag name has been changed from `:` to `|`
* Fixed blocking issue with denylisted origins and Wallarm Console UI-configured mode
* Internal improvements

### 0.15.1 (2025-07-08)

* Introduced the [`proxy_headers`](../../installation/native-node/all-in-one-conf.md#proxy_headers) configuration to configure trusted networks and extract real client IP and host headers

    This replaces `http_inspector.real_ip_header` used in earlier versions in the `tcp-capture` mode.
* Added the [`metrics.namespace`](../../installation/native-node/all-in-one-conf.md#metricsnamespace) configuration option to customize the prefix of Prometheus metrics exposed by the `go-node` binary
* Fixed the `--preserve` script flag behavior to correctly retain the existing `node.yaml` and `env.list` files during upgrade

    Previously, these files could be overwritten, resulting in loss of configuration.
* Added [`connector.per_connection_limits`](../../installation/native-node/all-in-one-conf.md#connectorper_connection_limits) to control `keep-alive` connection limits
* Minor internal file structure change
* Fixed wstore ports binding: now bound to `127.0.0.1` instead of `0.0.0.0`
* Fixed the [CVE-2025-22874](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-22874) vulnerability
* Fixed the [CVE-2025-47273](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-47273) vulnerability

* Added support for external health check endpoint in the `connector-server` mode

    This is controlled by the new [`connector.external_health_check`](../../installation/native-node/all-in-one-conf.md#connectorexternal_health_check) configuration section.
* Fixed a recurring intermittent bug that could cause occasional corruption of request and response bodies
* The following fixes and updates were made in `tcp-capture` mode:

    * GoReplay is now built with Go 1.24
    * Fixed: `go-node` process no longer hangs when the `goreplay` process crashes
    * Fixed a crash caused by a slice out-of-bounds error during header parsing in GoReplay
* Fixed incorrect display of Native Node versions in Wallarm Console â†’ **Nodes**

### 0.14.0 (2025-04-16)

* Wallarm Node now uses **wstore**, a Wallarm-developed service, instead of Tarantool for local postanalytics processing
* The collectd service, previously installed on all filtering nodes, has been removed along with its related plugins
    
    Metrics are now collected and sent using Wallarm's built-in mechanisms, reducing dependencies on external tools.

## Helm chart

    * `wallarm_gonode_application_info` with the general Native Node instance information, e.g.:
    
        ```bash
        wallarm_gonode_application_info{deployment_type="node-native-aio-installer",mode="connector-server",version="0.16.1"} 1
        ```

    * `wallarm_gonode_http_inspector_errors_total` now includes a new `type="FlowTimeouts"`
* Deprecated the Wallarm Connector for [Istio that relied on a Lua plugin](/5.x/installation/connectors/istio/)

    We recommend using the [gRPC-based external processing filter for Istio](../../installation/connectors/istio.md) instead.
* For the deprecated Istio connector, the following improvements were made to ensure compatibility in existing deployments:

    * Fixed mesh balancing logic for messages
    * Added the `disable_mesh` parameter to process all connector traffic on the Node without mesh balancing (`false` by default - mesh balancing is enabled)
