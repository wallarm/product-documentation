# Native Node Artifact Versions and Changelog

This document lists available [versions](../versioning-policy.md) of the [Native Wallarm Node](../../installation/nginx-native-node-internals.md#native-node) 0.x in various form factors, helping you track releases and plan upgrades.

## All-in-one installer

The all-in-one installer for the Native Node is used for [TCP traffic mirror analysis](../../installation/oob/tcp-traffic-mirror/deployment.md) and self-hosted node deployment with the [MuleSoft](../../installation/connectors/mulesoft.md), [CloudFront](../../installation/connectors/aws-lambda.md), [Cloudflare](../../installation/connectors/cloudflare.md), [Broadcom Layer7 API Gateway](../../installation/connectors/layer7-api-gateway.md), [Fastly](../../installation/connectors/fastly.md) connectors.

History of all-in-one installer updates simultaneously applies to it's x86_64 and ARM64 (beta) versions.

[How to upgrade](all-in-one.md)

### 0.12.0 (2025-02-05)

* Added support for response parameters in [API Sessions](../../api-sessions/overview.md) for providing the full context of user activities and more precise [session grouping](../../api-sessions/setup.md#session-grouping) (see detailed [change description](../../updating-migrating/what-is-new.md#response-parameters-in-api-sessions))
* Added a full-fledged [GraphQL parser](../../user-guides/rules/request-processing.md#gql) (see detailed [change description](../../updating-migrating/what-is-new.md#full-fledged-graphql-parser)) that allows:

    * Improved detection of the input validation attacks in GraphQL-specific request points
    * Fine-tuning attack detection for specific GraphQL points (e.g. disable detection of specific attack types in specific points)
    * Analyzing specific parts of GraphQL requests in API sessions

* Fixed invalid time value in serialized requests to properly display the [resource overlimit](../../user-guides/rules/configure-overlimit-res-detection.md) attacks
* Fixed problem for the `invalid_xml` attack detection in responses
* Fixed an issue where user-overridden headers were being dropped

### 0.11.0 (2025-01-31)

* Added support for the [`WALLARM_APID_ONLY` environment variable](../../installation/native-node/all-in-one.md#installer-launch-options) which enables API Discovery-only mode

    In this mode, attacks are blocked locally (if enabled) but not exported to Wallarm Cloud, while [API Discovery](../../api-discovery/overview.md), [API session tracking](../../api-sessions/overview.md), and [security vulnerability detection](../../about-wallarm/detecting-vulnerabilities.md) remain fully functional. This mode is rarely needed, in most environments, using this mode is unnecessary.
* Improved the Native Node's interaction with GoReplay, resulting in the following configuration changes:

    ``` diff
    -version: 2
    +version: 3

    -middleware:
    +goreplay:
      parse_responses: true
      response_timeout: 5s
      url_normalize: true
    ```

    During upgrade, update the `version` value and replace the `middleware` section with `goreplay` if explicitly specified in the initial configuration file.
* Fixed a small HTTP parsing bug in the `tcp-capture` mode

### 0.10.1 (2025-01-02)

* Added support for sensitive business flows in [API Discovery](../../api-discovery/sbf.md) and [API Sessions](../../api-sessions/exploring.md#sensitive-business-flows)
* Added support for the [Fastly](../../installation/connectors/fastly.md) connector
* Fixed potential request loss at mesh startup
* Resolved the [CVE-2024-45337](https://scout.docker.com/vulnerabilities/id/CVE-2024-45337) and [CVE-2024-45338](https://scout.docker.com/vulnerabilities/id/CVE-2024-45338) vulnerabilities
* Fixed an issue where some requests were processed unsuccessfully, potentially affecting API Sessions, Credential Stuffing, and API Abuse Prevention

### 0.10.0 (2024-12-19)

* Added URL normalization before selecting route configurations and analyzing data with libproton in `tcp-capture` mode

    This is controlled by the [`middleware.url_normalize`](../../installation/native-node/all-in-one-conf.md#goreplayurl_normalize) parameter (`true` by default).
* Introduced the [`http_inspector.wallarm_process_time_limit`](../../installation/native-node/all-in-one-conf.md#http_inspectorwallarm_process_time_limit) parameter to control request processing time locally

    The default is `1s` unless overridden by Wallarm Console settings.
* Prometheus metrics updates (available in the :9000 port):

    * Removed obsolete metrics with static zero values.
    * Enhanced `http_inspector_requests_processed` and `http_inspector_threats_found` metrics with `anything` allowed to be specified in `source` label values.
    * Added the `http_inspector_adjusted_counters` metric for tracking request and attack counts.

### 0.9.1 (2024-12-10)

* Minor bug fixes

### 0.9.0 (2024-12-04)

* The default endpoint for JSON-formatted `/wallarm-status` metrics has changed to `127.0.0.1:10246` (the `metrics.legacy_status.listen_address` parameter value). This legacy service is critical for Node functionality but does not require direct interaction.

### 0.8.3 (2024-11-14)

* Added support for Mulesoft connector 3.0.x

### 0.8.2 (2024-11-11)

* [Improved](../what-is-new.md#new-in-limiting-request-processing-time) limiting request processing time
* Changed default values for the following parameters:

    * The [`connector.blocking`](../../installation/native-node/all-in-one-conf.md#connectorblocking) parameter now defaults to `true`, enabling the Native Node's general capability to block incoming requests without manual configuration during deployment.
    * The [`route_config.wallarm_mode`](../../installation/native-node/all-in-one-conf.md#route_configwallarm_mode) parameter, which sets the traffic filtration mode, now defaults to `monitoring`, providing an optimal setup for initial deployments.
* Added URL normalization before selecting route configurations and analyzing data with libproton (controlled by the [`controller.url_normalize`](../../installation/native-node/all-in-one-conf.md#connectorurl_normalize) parameter which is set to `true` by default)
* Reduced memory usage during node registration
* Some bug fixes

### 0.7.0 (2024-10-16)

* Fixed an issue where some internal service connector headers were not being stripped before processing
* Added support for the mesh feature in `connector-server` mode, enabling consistent request/response routing across multiple node replicas

    This introdcues the new configuration parameters under [`connector.mesh`](../../installation/native-node/all-in-one-conf.md#connectormesh) to configure the mesh functionality.

### 0.6.0 (2024-10-10)

* Added support for [customizing sensitive data detection](../../api-discovery/setup.md#customizing-sensitive-data-detection) in API Discovery
* Fixed memory leak on duplicate response headers in [libproton](../../about-wallarm/protecting-against-attacks.md#library-libproton)
* Fixed memory leak related to IP addresses that are not in [IP lists](../../user-guides/ip-lists/overview.md) but have [known source](../../user-guides/ip-lists/overview.md#select-object)
* Updated artifact naming from "next" to "native"
    
    `https://meganode.wallarm.com/next/aionext-<VERSION>.<ARCH>.sh` â†’ `https://meganode.wallarm.com/native/aio-native-<VERSION>.<ARCH>.sh`

* Fixed delays in attack export
* Fixed an issue with the C memory allocator that caused a performance slowdown

### 0.5.0 (2024-09-11)

* Minor technical improvements and optimizations

### 0.4.3 (2024-09-05)
