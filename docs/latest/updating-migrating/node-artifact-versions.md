### 4.8.1 (2023-11-15)

* Optimize Wallarm Cloud's export of brute, dirbust, and BOLA statistics to avoid delays in reaction to attacks under high request loads and numerous triggers

### 4.8.0 (2023-10-19)

* Initial release 4.8, [see changelog](what-is-new.md)
* Added support for [API tokens](../user-guides/nodes/nodes.md#api-and-node-tokens-for-node-creation) to create filtering nodes and connect them to the Cloud during solution deployment. With API tokens, you can control the lifetime of your tokens and enhance node organization in the UI by setting a node group name.

    Node group names are set using the `config.wallarm.api.nodeGroup` parameter in **values.yaml**, with `defaultSidecarGroup` as the default name. Optionally, you can control the names of node groups based on the applications' pods using the `sidecar.wallarm.io/wallarm-node-group` annotation.
