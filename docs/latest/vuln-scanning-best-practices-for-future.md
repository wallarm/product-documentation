## Follow the best practices for Threat Replay Testing <a href="../subscription-plans/#core-subscription-plans"><img src="../../images/api-security-tag.svg" style="border: none;margin-bottom: -4px;"></a>

One method Wallarm uses to [detect vulnerabilities](../about-wallarm/detecting-vulnerabilities.md) is **Threat Replay Testing**.

**Threat Replay Testing** lets you turn attackers into penetration testers and discover possible security issues from their activity as they probe your apps/APIs for vulnerabilities. This module finds possible vulnerabilities by probing application endpoints using real attack data from the traffic. By default this method is disabled.
