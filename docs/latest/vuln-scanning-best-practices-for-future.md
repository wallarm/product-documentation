Vulnerability Detection and Mitigation Best Practices

## Follow the best practices for Active threat verification <a href="../subscription-plans/#subscription-plans"><img src="../../images/api-security-tag.svg" style="border: none;margin-bottom: -4px;"></a>

One method Wallarm uses to [detect vulnerabilities](../about-wallarm/detecting-vulnerabilities.md) is **Active threat verification**.

**Active threat verification** lets you turn attackers into penetration testers and discover possible security issues from their activity as they probe your apps/APIs for vulnerabilities. This module finds possible vulnerabilities by probing application endpoints using real attack data from the traffic. By default this method is disabled.
