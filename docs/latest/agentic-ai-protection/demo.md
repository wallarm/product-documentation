# Agentic AI Protection Demo

Wallarm's [Agentic AI Protection](overview.md) is currently an **early access** feature under development - you can go through the demo.

## Demo

This demo provides you with the ability to interactively go go through several examples of how Agentic AI can be exploited and how this attempts of exploitation are mitigated by Wallarm.

## Demonstrated cases

This demo demonstrates the following cases:

* Exploit BOLA through the agent
* System prompt retrieval and business logic abuse
* Identity impersonation and tool misuse

On completing any of the scenarios, Wallarm detects the attack and mitigates them in the correspondence with the mitigation mode - you obtain a [working link](https://sales.playground.wallarm.com/api-sessions) to the **API Sessions** section of Wallarm Playground, where you can explore the session and the attack inside it.
