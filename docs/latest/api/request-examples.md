# Wallarm API request examples

The following are some examples of Wallarm API use. You can also generate code examples via the API Reference UI for the [US cloud](https://apiconsole.us1.wallarm.com/) or [EU cloud](https://apiconsole.eu1.wallarm.com/). Experienced users can also use the browser’s Developer console (“Network” tab) to quickly learn which API endpoints and requests are used by the UI of your Wallarm account to fetch data from the public API. To find information about how to open the Developer console, you can use the official browser documentation ([Safari](https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/use-the-developer-tools-in-the-develop-menu-sfri20948/mac), [Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/), [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools), [Vivaldi](https://help.vivaldi.com/article/developer-tools/)).

## Get a large number of attacks (100 and more)

For attack and hit sets containing 100 or more records, it is best to retrieve them in smaller pieces rather than fetching large datasets all at once, in order to optimize performance. The corresponding Wallarm API endpoints support cursor-based pagination with 100 records per page.

This technique involves returning a pointer to a specific item in the dataset and then on subsequent requests, the server returns results after the given pointer. To enable cursor pagination, include `"paging": true` in the request parameters.

The following are examples of API calls for retrieving all attacks detected since `<TIMESTAMP>` using the cursor pagination:

=== "EU Cloud"
    ```bash
    curl -k 'https://api.wallarm.com/v2/objects/attack' \
      -X POST \
      -H 'X-WallarmApi-Token: <YOUR_TOKEN>' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{"paging": true, "filter": {"clientid": [<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>], "vulnid": null, "time": [[<TIMESTAMP>, null]], "!state": "falsepositive"}}'
    ```
=== "US Cloud"
    ```bash
    curl -k 'https://us1.api.wallarm.com/v2/objects/attack' \
      -X POST \
      -H 'X-WallarmApi-Token: <YOUR_TOKEN>' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{"paging": true, "filter": {"clientid": [<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>], "vulnid": null, "time": [[<TIMESTAMP>, null]], "!state": "falsepositive"}}'
    ```

This request returns information on the latest 100 attacks detected, arranged from the most recent to the earliest. In addition, the response includes a `cursor` parameter that contains a pointer to the next set of 100 attacks.

To retrieve the next 100 attacks, use the same request as before but include the `cursor` parameter with the pointer value copied from the response of the previous request. This allows the API to know where to start returning the next set of 100 attacks from, e.g.:

=== "EU Cloud"
    ```bash
    curl -k 'https://api.wallarm.com/v2/objects/attack' \
      -X POST \
      -H 'X-WallarmApi-Token: <YOUR_TOKEN>' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{"cursor":"<POINTER_FROM_PREVIOUS_RESPONSE>", "paging": true, "filter": {"clientid": [<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>], "vulnid": null, "time": [[<TIMESTAMP>, null]], "!state": "falsepositive"}}'
    ```
=== "US Cloud"
    ```bash
    curl -k 'https://us1.api.wallarm.com/v2/objects/attack' \
      -X POST \
      -H 'X-WallarmApi-Token: <YOUR_TOKEN>' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{"cursor":"<POINTER_FROM_PREVIOUS_RESPONSE>", "paging": true, "filter": {"clientid": [<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>], "vulnid": null, "time": [[<TIMESTAMP>, null]], "!state": "falsepositive"}}'
    ```

To retrieve further pages of results, execute requests including the `cursor` parameter with the value copied from the previous response.

Below is the Python code example for retrieving attacks using cursor paging:

=== "EU Cloud"
    ```python
    import json
    from pprint import pprint as pp

    import requests


    client_id = <YOUR_CLIENT_ID>
    ts = <TIMESTAMP>  # UNIX time

    url = "https://api.wallarm.com/v2/objects/attack"
    headers = {
        "X-WallarmApi-Token": "<YOUR_TOKEN>",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    }
    payload = {
        "paging": True,
        "filter": {
            "clientid": [client_id],
            "vulnid": None,
            "time": [[ts, None]],
            "!state": "falsepositive",
        },
    }


    while True:
        response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
        data = response.json()

        cursor = data.get("cursor")
        if not cursor:
            break

        pp(data)
        payload["cursor"] = cursor
    ```
=== "US Cloud"
    ```python
    import json
    from pprint import pprint as pp

    import requests


    client_id = <YOUR_CLIENT_ID>
    ts = <TIMESTAMP>  # UNIX time

    url = "https://us1.api.wallarm.com/v2/objects/attack"
    headers = {
        "X-WallarmApi-Token": "<YOUR_TOKEN>",
        "X-WallarmAPI-Secret": "<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    }
    payload = {
        "paging": True,
        "filter": {
            "clientid": [client_id],
            "vulnid": None,
            "time": [[ts, None]],
            "!state": "falsepositive",
        },
    }


    while True:
        response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
        data = response.json()

        cursor = data.get("cursor")
        if not cursor:
            break

        pp(data)
        payload["cursor"] = cursor
    ```

## Get the first 50 incidents confirmed in the last 24 hours

The request is very similar to the previous example for a list of attacks; the `"!vulnid": null` term is added to this request. This term instructs the API to ignore all attacks without specified vulnerability ID, and this is how the system distinguishes between attacks and incidents.

Please replace `TIMESTAMP` with the date 24 hours ago converted to the [Unix Timestamp](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/) format.

--8<-- "../include/api-request-examples/get-incidents-en.md"

## Get the first 50 vulnerabilities in the status "active" within the last 24 hours

Please replace `TIMESTAMP` with the date 24 hours ago converted to the [Unix Timestamp](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/) format.

--8<-- "../include/api-request-examples/get-vulnerabilities.md"

## Get all configured rules

--8<-- "../include/api-request-examples/get-all-configured-rules.md"

## Get only conditions of all rules

--8<-- "../include/api-request-examples/get-conditions.md"

## Get rules attached to a specific condition

To point to a specific condition, use its ID - you can get it when requesting conditions of all rules (see above).

--8<-- "../include/api-request-examples/get-rules-by-condition-id.md"

## Create the virtual patch to block all requests sent to `/my/api/*`

--8<-- "../include/api-request-examples/create-rule-en.md"

## Create the virtual patch for a specific application instance ID to block all requests sent to `/my/api/*`

An application should be [configured](../user-guides/settings/applications.md) before sending this request. Specify an ID of an existing application in `action.point[instance].value`.

--8<-- "../include/api-request-examples/create-rule-for-app-id.md"

## Create a rule to consider the requests with specific value of the `X-FORWARDED-FOR` header as attacks

The following request will create the [custom attack indicator based on the regexp](../user-guides/rules/regex-rule.md) `^(~(44[.]33[.]22[.]11))$`.

If requests to domain `MY.DOMAIN.COM` have the `X-FORWARDED-FOR: 44.33.22.11` HTTP header, the Wallarm node will consider them to be scanner attacks and block attacks if the corresponding [filtration mode](../admin-en/configure-wallarm-mode.md) has been set.

--8<-- "../include/api-request-examples/create-rule-scanner.md"

## Create the rule setting filtration mode to monitoring for the specific application

The following request will create the [rule setting the node to filter traffic](../admin-en/configure-wallarm-mode.md#setting-up-endpoint-targeted-filtration-rules-in-wallarm-console) going to the [application](../user-guides/settings/applications.md) with ID `3` in the monitoring mode.

--8<-- "../include/api-request-examples/create-filtration-mode-rule-for-app.md"

## Delete rule by its ID

You can copy the rule ID to be deleted when [getting all configured rules](#get-all-configured-rules). Also, a rule ID has been returned in response to the rule creation request, in the `id` response parameter.

--8<-- "../include/api-request-examples/delete-rule-by-id.md"

## API calls to get, populate and delete IP list objects

Below are some examples of the API calls to get, populate and delete [IP list](../user-guides/ip-lists/overview.md) objects.

### API request parameters

Parameters to be passed in the API requests to read and change IP lists:

--8<-- "../include/api-request-examples/ip-list-request-params.md"

### Add to the list the entries from the `.csv` file

To add to the list the IPs or subnets from the `.csv` file, use the following bash script:

--8<-- "../include/api-request-examples/add-ips-to-lists-from-file.md"

### Add to the list a single IP or subnet

--8<-- "../include/api-request-examples/add-some-ips-to-lists.md"

### Add to the list multiple countries

--8<-- "../include/api-request-examples/add-some-countries-to-lists.md"

### Add to the list multiple proxy services

--8<-- "../include/api-request-examples/add-some-proxies-to-lists.md"

### Delete an object from the IP list

Objects are deleted from IP lists by their IDs.

To get an object ID, request the IP list contents and copy `objects.id` of the required object from a response:

--8<-- "../include/api-request-examples/get-ip-list-contents.md"

Having the object ID, send the following request to delete it from the list:

--8<-- "../include/api-request-examples/delete-object-from-ip-list.md"

You can delete multiple objects at once passing their IDs as an array in the deletion request.
