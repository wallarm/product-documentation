#   Text formatting conventions

Throughout the guides you will be presented with a certain number of text strings and commands to be entered or executed. You will be provided with different formattings of some strings and command keywords when necessary. The following rules are applicable throughout the guides:


| Formatting rule                 | Description |
| -----------------------------  | ------------------------------------------------------------    |
|`regular` | Strings that are written in regular monospaced font are informational and are not supposed to be entered by the reader.<br>Such strings could represent a command output or other piece of information.|
|Example: | The invitation of a Bash shell:<br>`$`                     |
|**`boldface`**  | Strings that are written in boldface monospaced font should be entered by the reader “as is.” |
|Example: | To view system information in Linux, enter the following command:<br>`$` **`uname -a`** |
|*`italics`* or  *`<italics>`* | Strings that are written in italic, monospaced font represent values that should be provided by the reader. For example, if a command argument is formatted as *`<name>`*, you should provide some value as that name, instead of *`<name>*`.<br>If an input cannot be described in a single word, then the string is placed within pair of <...> brackets. You should omit the brackets while entering a value. For example, if a command arguments is formatted as *`<user password>`*, you should enter the password without the < and > symbols. |
|Example: | The `cat` command can be used to view content of a file in Linux in the following way:<br>`$` **`cat`** *`filename`*<br>`$` **`cat`** *`<file name>`*<br><br>If you need to view the content of the file named MyFile.txt, execute the following command:<br>`cat MyFile.txt` |
