#   FAST Node Self-signed SSL-certificate Installation for Microsoft Edge

To install the certificate for the Microsoft Edge browser, do the following:

1.  Make sure that you have set up your browser to use the FAST node as the HTTP and HTTPS proxy.

2.  Request the file `cert.der` from any domain via HTTP using the browser.

    For example, you can use one of the following links:
    
    * <http://wallarm.get/cert.der>
    * <http://example.com/cert.der> 

    The browser will give you the choice to open the certificate file or to save it. Select the **Open** button.

3.  A window will open, containing information about the certificate. Notice that the name and expiration date of your certificate will differ from those shown in the image. Select the **Install Certificate** button.

    Given that the import is successsful, “The import was successful” informational message will appear.

7.  Check that the certificate was installed correctly. To do that, go to any site via HTTPS. You should be redirected to the HTTPS version of the site without any warning messages about untrusted certificates.

    For example, you could browse to the HTTPS version of the Google Gruyere site:
    <https://google-gruyere.appspot.com>
