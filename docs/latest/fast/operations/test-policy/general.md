# Basic Policy Configuration

When creating or editing the policy, you will be directed to the **General** section of the policy editor in your Wallarm account. This section contains general policy settings:

![General section of the policy editor][img-tab-general]

The section requires the filling in of the following fields:

* policy name
* policy description

You can also add one or more tags to the policy. This allows you to quickly find tests used in a particular policy with this tag.

The first part of the policy editor contains the following options:

* Statistics on the policy usage (this data is only available for existing policies)
* Test policy described in the text format
