# Running Docker Envoy‑based image

## Image overview

These instructions describe the steps to run the Wallarm Docker image based on [Envoy 1.18.4](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/version_history/v1.18.4). The image contains all systems required for correct Wallarm node operation:

* Envoy proxy services with embedded Wallarm API Security module
* Tarantool modules for postanalytics
* Other services and scripts

Wallarm API Security module is designed as an Envoy HTTP filter for requests proxying.

!!! warning "Supported configuration parameters"
    Please note that the most [directives](../../configure-parameters-en.md) for the NGINX‑based filtering node configuration are not supported for the Envoy‑based filtering node configuration. See the list of parameters available for the [Envoy‑based filtering node configuration →](../../configuration-guides/envoy/fine-tuning.md)

--8<-- "../include/waf/installation/already-deployed-envoy-docker-image.md"

## Requirements

* Access to the account with the **Administrator** role in Wallarm Console in the [EU Cloud](https://my.wallarm.com/) or [US Cloud](https://us1.my.wallarm.com/)
* Access to `https://api.wallarm.com` if working with EU Wallarm Cloud or `https://us1.api.wallarm.com` if working with US Wallarm Cloud. Please ensure the access is not blocked by a firewall

## Options for running the container

The filtering node configuration parameters can be passed to the `docker run` command in the following ways:

* **In the environment variables**. This option allows for configuration of only basic filtering node parameters, the most [parameters](../../configuration-guides/envoy/fine-tuning.md) cannot be changed through environment variables.
* **In the mounted configuration file**. This option allows for configuration of all the filtering node [parameters](../../configuration-guides/envoy/fine-tuning.md).

## Run the container passing the environment variables

1. Open Wallarm Console → **Nodes** in the [EU Cloud](https://my.wallarm.com/nodes) or [US Cloud](https://us1.my.wallarm.com/nodes) and create the node of the **Wallarm node** type.

    ![!Wallarm node creation](../../../images/user-guides/nodes/create-cloud-node.png)
1. Copy the generated token.
1. Run the container with the created node:

    === "EU Cloud"
        ```bash
        docker run -d -e DEPLOY_TOKEN='XXXXXXX' -e ENVOY_BACKEND='example.com' -p 80:80 wallarm/envoy:3.6.1-1
        ```
    === "US Cloud"
        ```bash
        docker run -d -e DEPLOY_TOKEN='XXXXXXX' -e ENVOY_BACKEND='example.com' -e WALLARM_API_HOST='us1.api.wallarm.com' -p 80:80 wallarm/envoy:3.6.1-1
        ```

You can pass the following basic filtering node settings to the container via the option `-e`:

Environment variable | Description| Required
--- | ---- | ----
`DEPLOY_TOKEN` | Wallarm node token.<br><div class="admonition info"> <p class="admonition-title">Previous variables configuring access to the Wallarm Cloud</p> <p>Before the release of version 4.0, the variables prior to `DEPLOY_TOKEN` were `DEPLOY_USERNAME` and `DEPLOY_PASSWORD`. Starting from the new release, it is recommended to use the new token-based approach to access the Wallarm Cloud. [More details on migrating to the new node version](/updating-migrating/docker-container/)</p></div> | Yes
`ENVOY_BACKEND` | Domain or IP address of the resource to protect with Wallarm API Security. | Yes
`WALLARM_API_HOST` | Wallarm API server:<ul><li>`api.wallarm.com` for the EU Cloud</li><li>`us1.api.wallarm.com` for the US Cloud</li></ul>By default: `api.wallarm.com`. | No
`WALLARM_MODE` | Node mode:<ul><li>`block` to block malicious requests</li><li>`safe_blocking` to block only those malicious requests originated from [greylisted IP addresses](../../../user-guides/ip-lists/greylist.md)</li><li>`monitoring` to analyze but not block requests</li><li>`off` to disable traffic analyzing and processing</li></ul>By default: `monitoring`.<br>[Detailed description of filtration modes →](../../configure-wallarm-mode.md) | No
`TARANTOOL_MEMORY_GB` | [Amount of memory](../../configuration-guides/allocate-resources-for-waf-node.md) allocated to Tarantool. The value can be an integer or a float (a dot <code>.</code> is a decimal separator). By default: 0.2 gygabytes. | No
`DEPLOY_FORCE` | Replaces an existing Wallarm node with a new one if an existing Wallarm node name matches the identifier of the container you are running. The following values can be assigned to a variable:<ul><li>`true` to replace the filtering node</li><li>`false` to disable the replacement of the filtering node</li></ul>Default value (if the variable is not passed to the container) is `false`.<br>The Wallarm node name always matches the identifier of the container you are running. Filtering node replacement is helpful if the Docker container identifiers in your environment are static and you are trying to run another Docker container with the filtering node (for example, a container with a new version of the image). If in this case the variable value is `false`, the filtering node creation process will fail. | No

The command does the following:

* Creates the file `envoy.yaml` with minimal Envoy configuration in the `/etc/envoy` container directory.
* Creates files with filtering node credentials to access the Wallarm Cloud in the `/etc/wallarm` container directory:
    * `node.yaml` with filtering node UUID and secret key
    * `private.key` with Wallarm private key
* Protects the resource `http://ENVOY_BACKEND:80`.

## Run the container mounting envoy.yaml

You can mount the prepared file `envoy.yaml` to the Docker container via the `-v` option. The file must contain the following settings:

* Filtering node settings as described in the [instructions](../../configuration-guides/envoy/fine-tuning.md)
* Envoy settings as described in the [Envoy instructions](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.15.0/configuration/overview/overview)

To run the container:

1. Open Wallarm Console → **Nodes** in the [EU Cloud](https://my.wallarm.com/nodes) or [US Cloud](https://us1.my.wallarm.com/nodes) and create the node of the **Wallarm node** type.

    ![!Wallarm node creation](../../../images/user-guides/nodes/create-cloud-node.png)
1. Copy the generated token.
1. Run the container with the created node:

    === "EU Cloud"
        ```bash
        docker run -d -e DEPLOY_TOKEN='XXXXXXX' -v /configs/envoy.yaml:/etc/envoy/envoy.yaml -p 80:80 wallarm/envoy:3.6.1-1
        ```
    === "US Cloud"
        ```bash
        docker run -d -e DEPLOY_TOKEN='XXXXXXX' -e WALLARM_API_HOST='us1.api.wallarm.com' -v /configs/envoy.yaml:/etc/envoy/envoy.yaml -p 80:80 wallarm/envoy:3.6.1-1
        ```

    * The `-e` option passes the following required environment variables to the container:

    Environment variable | Description| Required
    --- | ---- | ----
    `DEPLOY_TOKEN` | Wallarm node token.<br><div class="admonition info"> <p class="admonition-title">Previous variables configuring access to the Wallarm Cloud</p> <p>Before the release of version 4.0, the variables prior to `DEPLOY_TOKEN` were `DEPLOY_USERNAME` and `DEPLOY_PASSWORD`. Starting from the new release, it is recommended to use the new token-based approach to access the Wallarm Cloud. [More details on migrating to the new node version](/updating-migrating/docker-container/)</p></div> | Yes
    `WALLARM_API_HOST` | Wallarm API server:<ul><li>`api.wallarm.com` for the EU Cloud</li><li>`us1.api.wallarm.com` for the US Cloud</li></ul>By default: `api.wallarm.com`. | No
    `DEPLOY_FORCE` | Replaces an existing Wallarm node with a new one if an existing Wallarm node name matches the identifier of the container you are running. The following values can be assigned to a variable:<ul><li>`true` to replace the filtering node</li><li>`false` to disable the replacement of the filtering node</li></ul>Default value (if the variable is not passed to the container) is `false`.<br>The Wallarm node name always matches the identifier of the container you are running. Filtering node replacement is helpful if the Docker container identifiers in your environment are static and you are trying to run another Docker container with the filtering node (for example, a container with a new version of the image). If in this case the variable value is `false`, the filtering node creation process will fail. | No

    * The `-v` option mounts the directory with the configuration file `envoy.yaml` to the `/etc/envoy` container directory.

The command does the following:

* Mounts the file `envoy.yaml` into the `/etc/envoy` container directory.
* Creates files with filtering node credentials to access the Wallarm Cloud in the `/etc/wallarm` container directory:
    * `node.yaml` with filtering node UUID and secret key
    * `private.key` with Wallarm private key
* Protects the resource `http://ENVOY_BACKEND:80`.

## Configuration of log rotation (optional)

The log file rotation is preconfigured and enabled by default. You can adjust the rotation settings if necessary. These settings are located in the `/etc/logrotate.d` directory of the container.

## Testing Wallarm node operation

1. Send the request with test [SQLI](../../../attacks-vulns-list.md#sql-injection) and [XSS](../../../attacks-vulns-list.md#crosssite-scripting-xss) attacks to the protected resource address:

    ```
    curl http://localhost/?id='or+1=1--a-<script>prompt(1)</script>'
    ```
2. Open the Wallarm Console → **Events** section in the [EU Cloud](https://my.wallarm.com/search) or [US Cloud](https://us1.my.wallarm.com/search) and ensure attacks are displayed in the list.
