#   Exporting Metrics to InfluxDB via the `collectd` Network Plugin

This document provides an example of using the Network plugin to export metrics to the InfluxDB temporal database. It will also demonstrate how to visualize the metrics collected in InfluxDB using Grafana.

##  Example Workflow

--8<-- "../include/monitoring/metric-example.md"

![Example Workflow][img-network-plugin-influxdb]

The following deployment scheme is used in this document:
*   The Wallarm filter node is deployed on a host accessible via the `10.0.30.5` IP address and the `node.example.local` fully qualified domain name.
    
    The `network` plugin for `collectd` on the filter node is configured in such a way that all metrics will be sent to the `10.0.30.30` InfluxDB server on port `25826/UDP`.
    
      
    !!! info "Network plugin features"
        Please note that the plugin operates over UDP (see [using examples][link-collectd-networking] and [documentation][link-network-plugin] of the `network` plugin).
    
    
*   Both `influxdb` and grafana services are deployed as Docker containers on a separate host with the `10.0.30.30` IP address.

    The `influxdb` service with the InfluxDB database is configured as follows:

      * A `collectd` data source has been created (the `collectd` input according to InfluxDB terminology), which listens on the `25826/UDP` port and writes incoming metrics to a database called `collectd`.
      * Communication with the InfluxDB API occurs via the `8086/TCP` port.
      * The service shares a `sample-net` Docker network with the `grafana` service.
    
    
    
    The `grafana` service with Grafana is configured as follows:
    
      * The Grafana web console is available at `http://10.0.30.30:3000`.
      * The service shares the `sample-net` Docker network with the `influxdb` service.

##  Configuring Metrics Export to InfluxDB

### Deploying InfluxDB and Grafana

Deploy InfluxDB and Grafana on the Docker host:
1.  Create a working directory, for example, `/tmp/influxdb-grafana`, and navigate to it:
    
    ```
    mkdir /tmp/influxdb-grafana
    cd /tmp/influxdb-grafana
    ```
    
2.  For the InfluxDB data source to work, you will need a file named `types.db` that contains the `collectd` value types.
    
    This file describes the dataset specifications used by `collectd`. Such datasets include definitions of measurable types. Detailed information about this file is available [here][link-typesdb].
    
    [Download the `types.db` file][link-typesdb-file] from the GitHub repository of the `collectd` project and put it in the working directory.
    
3.  Get the basic InfluxDB configuration file by running the following command: 
    
    ```
    docker run --rm influxdb influxd config > influxdb.conf
    ```
    
4.  Enable the `collectd` data source in the `influxdb.conf` InfluxDB configuration file by changing the value of the `enabled` parameter in the `[[collectd]]` section from `false` to `true`.
    
    Leave other parameters unchanged.
   
    The section should look like this:
   
    ```
    [[collectd]]
      enabled = true
      bind-address = ":25826"
      database = "collectd"
      retention-policy = ""
      batch-size = 5000
      batch-pending = 10
      batch-timeout = "10s"
      read-buffer = 0
      typesdb = "/usr/share/collectd/types.db"
      security-level = "none"
      auth-file = "/etc/collectd/auth_file"
      parse-multivalue-plugin = "split"  
    ```
    
5.  Create a `docker-compose.yaml` file in the working directory with the following content:
   
    ```
    version: "3"
    
    services:
      influxdb:
        image: influxdb
        container_name: influxdb
        ports:
          - 8086:8086
          - 25826:25826/udp
        networks:
          - sample-net
        volumes:
          - ./:/var/lib/influxdb
          - ./influxdb.conf:/etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf:ro
          - ./types.db:/usr/share/collectd/types.db:ro
    
      grafana:
        image: grafana/grafana
        container_name: grafana
        restart: always
        ports:
          - 3000:3000
        networks:
          - sample-net
    
    networks:
      sample-net:
    ```

    According to the settings in `volumes:`, InfluxDB will use
    1.  The working directory as storage for the database.
    2.  The `influxdb.conf` configuration file that is located in the working directory.
    3.  The `types.db` file with the types of measurable values that is located in the working directory.  
    
6.  Build the services by executing the `docker-compose build` command.
    
7.  Run the services by executing the `docker-compose up -d influxdb grafana` command.
    
8.  Create a database named `collectd` for the corresponding InfluxDB data source by executing the following command:
   
    ```
    curl -i -X POST http://10.0.30.30:8086/query --data-urlencode "q=CREATE DATABASE collectd"
    ```
    
    The InfluxDB server should return a response similar to:
   
    ```
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json
    Request-Id: 23604241-b086-11e9-8001-0242ac190002
    X-Influxdb-Build: OSS
    X-Influxdb-Version: 1.7.7
    X-Request-Id: 23604241-b086-11e9-8001-0242ac190002
    Date: Sat, 27 Jul 2019 15:49:37 GMT
    Transfer-Encoding: chunked
    
    {"results":[{"statement_id":0}]}
    ```
    
At this point, InfluxDB should be running, ready to receive metrics from `collectd`, and Grafana should be ready to monitor and visualize the data stored in InfluxDB.

### Configuring `collectd`

Configure `collectd` to export metrics to InfluxDB:
1. Connect to the filter node (for example, by using the SSH protocol). Make sure you are logged in as root or another account with superuser privileges.
2. Create a file named `/etc/collectd/collectd.conf.d/export-to-influxdb.conf` with the following content:
   
    ```
    LoadPlugin network
    
    <Plugin "network">
        Server "10.0.30.30" "25826"
    </Plugin>
    ```
    
    The following entities are configured here:

    1.  The server, to send metrics to (`10.0.30.30`)
    2.  The port that server listens on (`25826/UDP`)
    
3. Restart the `collectd` service by running the appropriate command:

    --8<-- "../include/monitoring/collectd-restart-2.16.md"

Now InfluxDB receives all the metrics of the filter node. You can visualize the metrics you are interested in and monitor them [with Grafana][doc-grafana].
