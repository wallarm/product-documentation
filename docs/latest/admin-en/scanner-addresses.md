# Wallarm Scanner Addresses <a href="../../about-wallarm/subscription-plans/#subscription-plans"><img src="../../images/api-security-tag.svg" style="border: none;"></a>

This document provides the lists of [Wallarm Scanner](../user-guides/scanner.md) IP addresses for US and EU Clouds.

It is recommended to add addresses from the corresponding list to the **whitelists** of your software or hardware facilities (besides Wallarm) that you use to automatically filter and block traffic. This will [prevent](../user-guides/scanner.md#preventing-scanner-from-blocking) Wallarm Scanner from being blocked by these facilities.
