# Wallarm Health Check After Node Deployment

This document provides you with a checklist to ensure Wallarm operates correctly after a new filtering node deployment. You can also use this procedure to test health of any existing node.

!!! info "Health check results"
    A difference between described expected result and actual result may be a sign of problem in node functioning. It is recommended to give a special attention to such discrepancies and if necessary, contact the [Wallarm support team](https://support.wallarm.com/) for help.

## Node is registered in Cloud

To check:

1. Open Wallarm Console → **Configuration** → **Nodes**.
1. Apply filter to see only active nodes.
1. Find your node in the list. Click to view details.

## Node registers attacks

To check:

--8<-- "../include/waf/installation/test-waf-operation-no-stats.md"

## Node registers all traffic

To provide a full visibility of your traffic, Wallarm's [API Sessions](../api-sessions/overview.md) display all requests - malicious and legitimate - in the form of step-by-step user sessions.

To check:

1. Send a request to the resource protected by your node:

      ```
      curl http://<resource_URL>
      ```

      Or send several requests with a bash script:

      ```
      for (( i=0 ; $i<10 ; i++ )) ;
      do 
         curl http://<resource_URL> ;
      done
      ```

      This example is for 10 requests.

1. Open **Events** → **API Sessions**.
1. Find session with your requests and previously sent attack - all in one session.

## Node statistics service works

You can get filtering node operation statistics by requesting the `/wallarm-status` URL.

!!! info "The statistics service"
    You can read more about the statistics service and how to configure it [here](../admin-en/configure-statistics-service.md).

To check:

1. On the machine where the node is installed, run the command:

      ```
      curl http://127.0.0.8/wallarm-status
      ```

1. Check the output. It should be like:

      ```json

                  }

                  }
            ]
            }
      }
      ```

      This means that the filtering node statistics service is running and working properly.

## Node logs are collected

To check:

1. On the machine where the node is installed, go to `/opt/wallarm/var/log/wallarm`.
1. Check data in `wcli-out.log`: logs of most Wallarm services, including brute force detection, attack export to the Cloud, and the status of node synchronization with the Cloud, etc.

See details on other logs and log configuration [here](../admin-en/configure-logging.md).

## Node registers vulnerabilities

Wallarm detects [vulnerabilities](../glossary-en.md#vulnerability) in your application APIs.

To check:

1. Send a request to your resource:

      ```
      curl <RECOURSE_URL> -H 'jwt: eyJhbGciOiJub25lIiwidHlwIjoiSldUIn0.eyJjbGllbmRfaWQiOiIxIn0.' -H 'HOST: <TEST_HOST_NAME>'
      ```

      Note that if you already have a [weak JWT](../attacks-vulns-list.md#weak-authentication) vulnerability detected for the host (in any status, even closed), you need to specify a different `TEST_HOST_NAME` to see the new vulnerability registered.

1. Open Wallarm Console → **Events** → **Vulnerabilities** to check whether a weak JWT vulnerability was listed.

## IP lists work

In Wallarm, you can control access to your application APIs by allowlisting, denylisting, and graylisting of IP addresses the requests come from. Learn core logic of IP lists [here](../user-guides/ip-lists/overview.md).

To check:

1. Open Wallarm Console → **Events** → **Attacks** and locate attack created by you during the [Node registers attacks](#node-registers-attacks) check.
1. Copy attack source IP.
1. Go to Security Controls → **IP Lists** → **Allowlist**, and add copied source IP to this list.
1. Wait (about 2 minutes) until new IP list state is uploaded to the filtering node.
1. Send the same attack from this IP again. In **Attacks**, nothing should appear.
1. Remove the IP from the **Allowlist**.
1. Add the IP to the **Denylist**
1. Send legitimate requests as the ones in the [Node registers all traffic](#node-registers-all-traffic) step. The requests (even though the legitimate ones) should appear in **Attacks** as blocked.

## Rules work

In Wallarm, you can use [rules](../user-guides/rules/rules.md) to change how the system detects malicious requests and acts when such malicious requests are detected. You create rules in Cloud via Wallarm Console, they form your custom ruleset, then Cloud sends it to the filtering node where they start to work.

To check:

1. Check current custom ruleset ID and date using one of the methods:

      * In Wallarm Console → **Configuration** → **Nodes**, access your node details and note custom_ruleset ID number and time of installation.
      * In [node statistics](#node-statistics-service-works), note `custom_ruleset_id` and `custom_ruleset_apply_time`.
      * In the `wcli-out.log` [node log](#node-logs-are-collected), note the latest line containing `"lom"`, pay attention to `version` and `time` in that string.

1. Go to **Security Controls** → **Rules**.
1. Use **Add rule** → **Fine-tuning attack detection** → **Ignore certain attacks**, select to ignore **Path traversal** in `uri` part of request, then create the rule.
1. Check that data from first step is updated (may take 2-4 minutes).
1. Repeat attack from the [Node registers attacks](#node-registers-attacks) check. Now this attack should be ignored and not displayed in the **Attacks**.
1. Delete the rule.
