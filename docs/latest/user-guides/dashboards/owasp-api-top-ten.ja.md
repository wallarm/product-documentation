# OWASP API Security Top 10 Dasboards

The [OWASP API Security Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-api-security/) is a gold standard for the evaluation of security risk in APIs. To help you measure your API's security posture against these API threats, Wallarm offers the dashboards that provide clear visibility and metrics for threat mitigation.

The dashboards cover the OWASP API Security Top 10 risks of both the [2019](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2019/en/0x00-header/) and [2023](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0x00-header/) versions.

By using these dashboards, you can assess the overall security state and proactively address discovered security issues by setting up appropriate security controls.

## Threat assessment

Wallarm estimates the risk for each API threat based on applied **security controls** and discovered vulnerabilities:

* **Red** - it happens if there are no security controls applied or your APIs have active high risk vulnerabilities.
* **Yellow** - it happens if security controls are only partially applied or your APIs have active medium or low risk vulnerabilities.
* **Green** indicates that your APIs are protected and do not have open vulnerabilities.

For each OWASP API Top 10 threat you can find detailed info about the threat, available security controls, corresponding vulnerabilities, and investigate related attacks:

## Comparison of OWASP API Top 10 2019 and 2023

According to the OWASP project, the top security threats for 2023 are largely similar to those identified in 2019, with a few notable exceptions:

* The [API6:2019 Mass Assignment](https://github.com/OWASP/API-Security/blob/master/editions/2019/en/0xa6-mass-assignment.md) threat has been combined with [API3:2023 Broken Object Property Level Authorization](https://github.com/OWASP/API-Security/blob/master/editions/2023/en/0xa3-broken-object-property-level-authorization.md).
* The [API8:2019 Injection](https://github.com/OWASP/API-Security/blob/master/editions/2019/en/0xa8-injection.md) threat is no longer listed separately and has been included in the new [API10:2023 Unsafe Consumption of APIs](https://github.com/OWASP/API-Security/blob/master/editions/2023/en/0xaa-unsafe-consumption-of-apis.md) category.
* The [API10:2019 Insufficient Logging & Monitoring](https://github.com/OWASP/API-Security/blob/master/editions/2019/en/0xaa-insufficient-logging-monitoring.md) threat has been removed from the OWASP API Security Top 10.
* The list now includes two new API threats, namely [API6:2023 Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows](https://github.com/OWASP/API-Security/blob/master/editions/2023/en/0xa6-unrestricted-access-to-sensitive-business-flows.md), which introduces automated threats, and [API7:2023 Server Side Request Forgery](https://github.com/OWASP/API-Security/blob/master/editions/2023/en/0xa7-server-side-request-forgery.md), thereby underscoring the significance of these threats.
