# OWASP API Security Top 10 Dasboard

The [OWASP API Security Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-api-security/) is a gold standard for the evaluation of security risk in APIs. To help you measure your API's security posture against these API threats, Wallarm offers the dashboard that provides clear visibility and metrics for threat mitigation.

With OWASP API Security Top 10 dashboard you can assess the overall security state and proactively address discovered security issues by setting up appropriate security controls.

## Threat assessment

Wallarm estimates the risk for each API threat based on applied [security control](#wallarm-security-controls) and discovered vulnerabilities:

* **Red** - it happens if there are no security controls applied or your APIs have active high risk vulnerabilities.
* **Yellow** - it happens if security controls are only partially applied or your APIs have active medium or low risk vulnerabilities.
* **Green** indicates that your APIs are protected and donâ€™t have open vulnerabilities.

For each OWASP API Top 10 threat you can find detailed info about the threat, available security controls, corresponding vulnerabilities, and investigate related attacks:

## Wallarm security controls

Wallarm security platform provides full-fledged protection against OWASP API Security Top 10 by the following security controls:
