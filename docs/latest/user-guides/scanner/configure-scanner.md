# General Scanner Settings <a href="../../../about-wallarm/subscription-plans/#subscription-plans"><img src="../../../images/api-security-tag.svg" style="border: none;"></a>

## Scanner

This setting enables or disables the discovery of resources in the scope and searches for typical vulnerabilities.

To manually restart the scanning, if the setting is on, switch it off, and then switch it back on again.

!!! info "Viewing detected vulnerabilities"
    The vulnerabilities found by the scanner can be viewed on the [*Vulnerabilities*][link-vulnerabilities] tab of the web interface.

In the scanner settings, you can perform the following actions:
* Configuring the list of detected vulnerabilities
* Disabling and enabling vulnerability re-check

!!! info "Configuring the scanner"
    To see detailed information about configuring the scanner, proceed to this [link][link-scanner-modules].

## Active Threat Verification

This setting enables or completely disables [automatic attack reproduction](../../about-wallarm/detecting-vulnerabilities.md#active-threat-verification) by the scanner.
You can later manually run the attack verification by clicking the *Check* button or using the *Rules* tab.

## Scanner's RPS Limits

This setting limits the maximum load on the web application that will be generated by the scanner requests.

The maximum number of requests per second (RPS) can be configured
* to a domain
* to an IP address

If multiple domains are associated with the same IP address, then the speed of requests to this IP address will not exceed the limits for the IP address. If multiple IP addresses are associated with one domain, then the total speed of requests to these IP addresses within this domain will not exceed the limits for the domain.

Limits can be overridden for individual IP addresses or domains. This is done within the [network scope][link-scope-rps-limit] section.

To restore default scanner RPS settings, click the *Restore defaults* button.
