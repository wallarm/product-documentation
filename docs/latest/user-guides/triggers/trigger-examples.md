# Trigger examples

Learn real examples of [Wallarm triggers](triggers.md) to better understand this feature and configure triggers appropriately.

## Graylist IP if 4 or more malicious payloads are detected in 1 hour

If 4 or more different malicious payloads are sent to the protected resource from one IP address, this IP address will be graylisted for 1 hour for all applications in a Wallarm account.

If you have recently created the Wallarm account, this [trigger is already created and enabled](triggers.md#pre-configured-triggers-default-triggers). You can edit, disable, delete, or copy this trigger as well as the manually created triggers.

![Graylisting trigger](../../images/user-guides/triggers/trigger-example-graylist.png)

**To test the trigger:**

1. Send the following requests to the protected resource:

    ```bash
    curl 'http://localhost/?id=1%27%20UNION%20SELECT%20username,%20password%20FROM%20users--<script>prompt(1)</script>'
    curl 'http://localhost/?id=1%27%20select%20version();'
    curl http://localhost/instructions.php/etc/passwd
    ```

    There are 4 malicious payloads of the [SQLi](../../attacks-vulns-list.md#sql-injection), [XSS](../../attacks-vulns-list.md#crosssite-scripting-xss), and [Path Traversal](../../attacks-vulns-list.md#path-traversal) types.
1. Open Wallarm Console → **IP lists** → **Graylist** and check that the IP address from which the requests originated is graylisted for 1 hour.
1. Open the section **Events** and check that the attacks are displayed in the list:

    ![Three malicious payloads in UI](../../images/user-guides/triggers/test-3-attack-vectors-events.png)

    To search for attacks, you can use the filters, for example: `sqli` for the [SQLi](../../attacks-vulns-list.md#sql-injection) attacks, `xss` for the [XSS](../../attacks-vulns-list.md#crosssite-scripting-xss) attacks, `ptrav` for the [Path Traversal](../../attacks-vulns-list.md#path-traversal) attacks. All filters are described in the [instructions on search use](../../user-guides/search-and-filters/use-search.md).

The trigger is released in any node filtration mode, so that it will graylist IPs regardless of the node mode. However, the node analyzes the graylist only in the **safe blocking** mode. To block malicious requests originating from graylisted IPs, switch the node [mode](../../admin-en/configure-wallarm-mode.md#available-filtration-modes) to safe blocking learning its features first.

## Denylist IP if 4 or more malicious payloads are detected in 1 hour

If 4 or more different [malicious payloads](../../glossary-en.md#malicious-payload) are sent to the protected resource from one IP address, this IP address will be denylisted for 1 hour for all applications in a Wallarm account.

![Default trigger](../../images/user-guides/triggers/trigger-example-default.png)

**To test the trigger:**

1. Send the following requests to the protected resource:

    ```bash
    curl 'http://localhost/?id=1%27%20UNION%20SELECT%20username,%20password%20FROM%20users--<script>prompt(1)</script>'
    curl 'http://localhost/?id=1%27%20select%20version();'
    curl http://localhost/instructions.php/etc/passwd
    ```

    There are 4 malicious payloads of the [SQLi](../../attacks-vulns-list.md#sql-injection), [XSS](../../attacks-vulns-list.md#crosssite-scripting-xss), and [Path Traversal](../../attacks-vulns-list.md#path-traversal) types.
2. Open Wallarm Console → **IP lists** → **Denylist** and check that the IP address from which the requests originated is blocked for 1 hour.
1. Open the section **Events** and check that the attacks are displayed in the list:

    ![Three malicious payloads in UI](../../images/user-guides/triggers/test-3-attack-vectors-events.png)

    To search for attacks, you can use the filters, for example: `sqli` for the [SQLi](../../attacks-vulns-list.md#sql-injection) attacks, `xss` for the [XSS](../../attacks-vulns-list.md#crosssite-scripting-xss) attacks, `ptrav` for the [Path Traversal](../../attacks-vulns-list.md#path-traversal) attacks. All filters are described in the [instructions on search use](../../user-guides/search-and-filters/use-search.md).

If an IP address was denylisted by this trigger, the filtering node would block all malicious and legitimate requests that originated from this IP. To allow legitimate requests, you can configure the [graylisting trigger](#graylist-ip-if-4-or-more-malicious-payloads-are-detected-in-1-hour).

## Mark requests as a brute‑force attack if 31 or more requests are sent to the protected resource

To mark requests as a regular brute-force attack, the trigger with the condition **Brute force** should be configured.

If 31 or more requests are sent to `https://example.com/api/v1/login` in 30 seconds, these requests will be marked as [brute‑force attack](../../attacks-vulns-list.md#bruteforce-attack) and the IP address from which the requests originated will be added to the denylist.

![Brute force trigger with counter](../../images/user-guides/triggers/trigger-example6.png)

[Details on configuration of brute force protection and trigger testing →](../../admin-en/configuration-guides/protecting-against-bruteforce.md)

## Mark requests as a forced browsing attack if the 404 code is returned to 31 or more requests

To mark requests as a forced browsing attack, the trigger with the condition **Forced browsing** should be configured.

If the endpoint `https://example.com/**.**` returns 404 response code 31 or more times in 30 seconds, appropriate requests will be marked as a [forced browsing attack](../../attacks-vulns-list.md#forced-browsing) and a source IP address of these requests will be blocked.

Endpoint examples matching the URI value are `https://example.com/config.json`, `https://example.com/password.txt`.

![Forced browsing trigger](../../images/user-guides/triggers/trigger-example5.png)

[Details on configuration of brute force protection and trigger testing →](../../admin-en/configuration-guides/protecting-against-bruteforce.md)

## Mark requests as the BOLA attack

If 31 or more requests are sent to `https://example.com/shops/{shop_id}/financial_info` in 30 seconds, these requests will be marked as the [BOLA attack](../../attacks-vulns-list.md#broken-object-level-authorization-bola) and the IP address from which the requests originated will be added to the denylist.

![BOLA trigger](../../images/user-guides/triggers/trigger-example7.png)

[Details on configuration of BOLA protection and trigger testing →](../../admin-en/configuration-guides/protecting-against-bola.md)

## Detect weak JWTs

If a significant amount of incoming requests processed by the node 4.4 or above contains weak JWTs, record the corresponding [vulnerability](../vulnerabilities.md).

Weak JWTs are those that are:

* Unencrypted - there is no signing algorithm (the `alg` field is `none` or absent).
* Signed using compromised secret keys

If you have recently created the Wallarm account, this [trigger is already created and enabled](triggers.md#pre-configured-triggers-default-triggers). You can edit, disable, delete, or copy this trigger as well as the manually created triggers.

![Example for trigger on weak JWTs](../../images/user-guides/triggers/trigger-example-weak-jwt.png)

**To test the trigger:**

1. Generate a JWT signed using a [compromised secret key](https://github.com/wallarm/jwt-secrets), e.g.:

    ```
    eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyLCJyb2xlIjoiQWRtaW5pc3RyYXRvciJ9.p5DrumkF6oTBiUmdtDRT5YHqYL2D7p5YOp6quUrULYg
    ```
1. Generate some traffic with requests authenticated using a compromised JWT.
1. If a significant amount of incoming requests processed by the node 4.4 or above contains weak JWTs, Wallarm registers the vulnerability, e.g.:

    ![JWT vuln example](../../images/user-guides/vulnerabilities/weak-auth-vuln.png)

## Opsgenie notification if 2 or more incidents are detected in one second

If 2 or more incidents with the application server or database are detected in one second, the notification about this event will be sent to Opsgenie.

![Example of a trigger sending the data to Splunk](../../images/user-guides/triggers/trigger-example3.png)

**To test the trigger**, it is required to send the attack exploiting an active vulnerability to the protected resource. The Wallarm Console → **Vulnerabilities** section displays active vulnerabilities detected in your applications and the examples of attacks that exploit these vulnerabilities.

If the attack example is sent to the protected resource, Wallarm will record the incident. Two or more recorded incidents will trigger sending the following notification to Opsgenie:

```
[Wallarm] Trigger: The number of incidents exceeded the threshold

Notification type: incidents_exceeded

The number of detected incidents exceeded 1 in 1 second.
This notification was triggered by the "Notification about incidents" trigger.

Additional trigger’s clauses:
Target: server, database.

View events:
https://my.wallarm.com/search?q=incidents&time_from=XXXXXXXXXX&time_to=XXXXXXXXXX

Client: TestCompany
Cloud: EU
```

* `Notification about incidents` is the trigger name
* `TestCompany` is the name of your company account in Wallarm Console
* `EU` is the Wallarm Cloud where your company account is registered

!!! info "Protecting the resource from active vulnerability exploitation"
    To protect the resource from active vulnerability exploitation, we recommend patching the vulnerability in a timely manner. If the vulnerability cannot be patched on the application side, please configure a [virtual patch](../rules/vpatch-rule.md) to block attacks exploiting this vulnerability.

## Notification to Webhook URL if IP address is added to the denylist

If an IP address was added to the denylist, the webhook about this event will be sent to Webhook URL.

![Example of trigger for denylisted IP](../../images/user-guides/triggers/trigger-example4.png)

**To test the trigger:**

1. Open the Wallarm Console → **IP lists** → **Denylist** and add the IP address to the denylist. For example:

    ![Adding IP to the denylist](../../images/user-guides/triggers/test-ip-blocking.png)
2. Check that the following webhook was sent to the Webhook URL:

    ```
    [
        {
            "summary": "[Wallarm] Trigger: New IP address was denylisted",
            "description": "Notification type: ip_blocked\n\nIP address 1.1.1.1 was denylisted until 2021-06-10 02:27:15 +0300 for the reason Produces many attacks. You can review blocked IP addresses in the \"Denylist\" section of Wallarm Console.\nThis notification was triggered by the \"Notification about denylisted IP\" trigger. The IP is blocked for the application Application #8.\n\nClient: TestCompany\nCloud: EU\n",
            "details": {
            "client_name": "TestCompany",
            "cloud": "EU",
            "notification_type": "ip_blocked",
            "trigger_name": "Notification about denylisted IP",
            "application": "Application #8",
            "reason": "Produces many attacks",
            "expire_at": "2021-06-10 02:27:15 +0300",
            "ip": "1.1.1.1"
            }
        }
    ]
    ```

    * `Notification about denylisted IP` is the trigger name
    * `TestCompany` is the name of your company account in Wallarm Console
    * `EU` is the Wallarm Cloud where your company account is registered

## Group hits originating from the same IP into one attack

If more than 50 [hits](../../about-wallarm/protecting-against-attacks.md#hit) from the same IP address are detected in 15 minutes, the next hits from the same IP will be grouped into one attack in the [event list](../events/check-attack.md).

If you have recently created the Wallarm account, this [trigger is already created and enabled](triggers.md#pre-configured-triggers-default-triggers). You can edit, disable, delete, or copy this trigger as well as the manually created triggers.

![Example of a trigger for hit grouping](../../images/user-guides/triggers/trigger-example-group-hits.png)

**To test the trigger**, send 51 or more hits as follows:

* All hits are sent in 15 minutes
* The IP addresses of the hit sources are the same
* Hits have different attack types or parameters with malicious payloads or addresses the hits are sent to (so that the hits are not [grouped](../../about-wallarm/protecting-against-attacks.md#attack) into an attack by the basic method)
* Attack types are different from Brute force, Forced browsing, Resource overlimit, Data bomb and Virtual patch

Example:

* 10 hits to `example.com`
* 20 hits to `test.com`
* 40 hits to `example-domain.com`

The first 50 hits will appear in the event list as individual hits. All of the following hits will be grouped into one attack, e.g.:

![Hits grouped by IP into one attack](../../images/user-guides/events/attack-from-grouped-hits.png)

The [**Mark as false positive**](../events/false-attack.md#mark-an-attack-as-a-false-positive) button and the [active verification](../../about-wallarm/detecting-vulnerabilities.md#active-threat-verification) option will be unavailable for the attack.

## New endpoints in your API inventory

Changes may occur in your API. They will be discovered by the [**API Discovery**](../../api-discovery/overview.md) module. Possible [changes](../../api-discovery/track-changes.md) are:

* A new endpoint is discovered
* An endpoint has changes (new or deleted parameters)
* An endpoint is marked unused

To get notifications about some or all of these changes to your email or messenger, the trigger with the **Changes in API** condition should be configured.

In this example, if new endpoints for the `example.com` API host are discovered by the API Discovery module, the notification about this will be sent to your configured Slack channel.

![Changes in API trigger](../../images/user-guides/triggers/trigger-example-changes-in-api.png)

**To test the trigger:**

1. In **Integrations**, configure [integration with Slack](../../user-guides/settings/integrations/slack.md).
1. In **Triggers**, create trigger as shown above.
1. Send several requests to the `example.com/users` endpoint to get the `200` (`OK`) response.
1. In the **API Discovery** section, check that your endpoint was added with the **New** mark.
1. Check messages in your Slack channel like:
    ```
    [wallarm] A new endpoint has been discovered in your API

    Notification type: api_structure_changed

    The new GET example.com/users endpoint has been discovered in your API.

        Client: Client 001
        Cloud: US

        Details:

          application: Application 1802
          domain: example.com
          endpoint_path: /users
          http_method: GET
          change_type: added
          link: https://my.wallarm.com/api-discovery?instance=1802&method=GET&q=example.com%2Fusers
    ```
