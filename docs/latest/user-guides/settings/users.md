# Configuring Users

You can manage user accounts in the *Users* tab located in *Settings*.

!!! warning "Administrator access"
    Only users with the **Administrator** role can access this setting.

## User Roles

Users of Wallarm clients can have the following roles:

* **Administrator** with access to all Wallarm settings
* **Analyst** with access to view main Wallarm settings, information about attacks, [incidents][link-glossary-incident] and [vulnerabilities][link-glossary-vulnerability]
* **Read Only** with access to view main Wallarm settings
* **Deploy** with access to create Wallarm filtering nodes using the `addnode` script and with no access to Wallarm Console

    !!! warning "Using the Deploy role to install the Wallarm node 4.0"
        The **Deploy** user role is recommended to be used to install only nodes 3.6 and lower since the [`addnode` script is deprecated in the release of version 4.0](../../updating-migrating/what-is-new.md#unified-registration-of-nodes-in-the-wallarm-cloud-by-tokens).

The [multitenancy](../../waf-installation/multi-tenant/overview.md) feature also enables you to use the global roles **Global Administrator**, **Global Analyst**, **Global Read Only**. Global roles provide users with access to the technical tenant account and linked tenant accounts, regular roles provide users with access only to the technical tenant account.

More detailed information about access of different user roles to Wallarm entitites is provided in the table below. Entity management covers entity creating, editing, and deleting.
