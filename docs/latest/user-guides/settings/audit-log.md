## Filter the activity log records

The following parameters can be used to filter the activity log records:

* Case sensitive data on the user performed the action

      If the action was performed by the Wallarm technical support team, the username is `Technical support`. This value cannot be used to sort the activity log records.
* Action type
* Name of the object on which the action was performed
* Date when the action was performed
