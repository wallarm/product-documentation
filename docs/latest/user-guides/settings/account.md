## Enabling Two-Factor Authentication

You can use Google Authenticator (or similar apps supporting TOTP) to enable two-factor authentication.

!!! info "Unavailable if using SSO"
    If you are using the SSO authentication, the two-factor authentication cannot be enabled. The **Two-factor authentication** section will be unavailable.

1. Install the Google Authenticator app ([Android][link-2fa-android-app], [iOS][link-2fa-ios-app]) or any compatible one.
1. Click **Enable** in **Two-Factor Authentication** setting.
1. Scan the QR code that appears (or click the **manual entry** link and use the manual entry option).
1. Enter the 6-digit verification code generated by your app.
1. Enter your password.
1. Click **Confirm**.

Whenever you sign in you will be prompted for your second factor code after passing the password prompt. Get this code from your Google Authenticator app. 

The password is required if you want to turn two-factor authentication off. You cannot turn it off if the administrator activated [2FA enforcement mode](users.md#enforcing-for-all-users) for your company.
