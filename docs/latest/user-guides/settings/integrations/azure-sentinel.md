# Microsoft Sentinel

[Microsoft Azure Sentinel](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/products/microsoft-sentinel/) is a solution provided by Microsoft as part of its Azure cloud platform to help organizations monitor, detect, investigate, and respond to security threats and incidents across their entire cloud and on-premises environments. You can set up Wallarm to log events in Microsoft Sentinel.

## Setting up integration

In the Microsoft UI:

1. [Run Microsoft Sentinel on a Workspace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/quickstart-onboard#enable-microsoft-sentinel-).
1. Proceed to the Sentinel Workspace settings → **Agents** → **Log Analytics agent instructions** and copy the following data:

    * Workspace ID
    * Primary key

In the Wallarm Console UI:

1. Open the **Integrations** section.
1. Click the **Microsoft Sentinel** block or click the **Add integration** button and choose **Microsoft Sentinel**.
1. Enter an integration name.
1. Paste the copied Workspace ID and Primary key.
1. Optionally, specify the Azure Sentinel table for Wallarm events. If it does not exist, it will be auto-created. 

    Without a name, separate tables are created for each event type.
1. Choose event types to trigger notifications.

    Details on available events:

    --8<-- "../include/integrations/advanced-events-for-integrations.md"

1. Click **Test integration** to check configuration correctness, availability of the Wallarm Cloud, and the notification format.

    You can find Wallarm logs in your Microsoft Workspace → **Logs** → **Custom Logs**, e.g. the test `create_user_CL` log in Microsoft Sentinel looks as follows:

    ![Test Sentinel message](../../../images/user-guides/settings/integrations/test-sentinel-new-vuln.png)

    !!! info "Delay in sending data to new workspaces"
        Creating a Workspace on Sentinel for Wallarm integration can take up to 1 hour for all services to function. This delay can result in errors during integration testing and usage. If all integration settings are correct but errors continue to appear, please try again after 1 hour.

1. Click **Add integration**.

## Types of Wallarm logs
