# Slack

You can set up Wallarm to send notifications to your Slack channel(s). If you want to send notifications to several different Slack channels or accounts, create several Slack integrations.

## Setting up integration

1. Open the **Integrations** section.
1. Click the **Slack** block or click the **Add integration** button and choose **Slack**.
1. Enter an integration name.
1. Open [Webhook settings in Slack](https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook/) and add a new Webhook choosing the channel to post messages to.
1. Copy the provided Webhook URL and paste the value to the **Webhook URL** field in Wallarm UI.
1. Choose event types to trigger notifications.

    Details on available events:
      
    --8<-- "../include/integrations/events-for-integrations.md"

1. Click **Test integration** to check configuration correctness, availability of the Wallarm Cloud, and the notification format.

    This will send a test notification with the prefix `[Test message]`:

    ```
    [Test message] [Test partner] Network perimeter has changed

    Notification type: new_scope_object_ips

    New IP addresses were discovered in the network perimeter:
    8.8.8.8

    Client: TestCompany
    Cloud: EU
    ```

1. Click **Add integration**.

## Examples

### Slack notification if 2 or more SQLi hits are detected in one minute

If 2 or more SQLi [hits](../../glossary-en.md#hit) are sent to the protected resource, then a notification about this event will be sent to the Slack channel.

![Example of a trigger sending the notification to Slack](../../images/user-guides/triggers/trigger-example1.png)

**To test the trigger:**

Send the following requests to the protected resource:

```bash
curl 'http://localhost/?id=1%27%20UNION%20SELECT%20username,%20password%20FROM%20users--<script>prompt(1)</script>'
curl 'http://localhost/?id=1%27%20select%20version();'
```
Open the Slack channel and check that the following notification from the user **wallarm** received:

```
[Wallarm] Trigger: The number of detected hits exceeded the threshold

Notification type: attacks_exceeded

The number of detected hits exceeded 1 in 1 minute.
This notification was triggered by the "Notification about SQLi hits" trigger.

Additional trigger’s clauses:
Attack type: SQLi.

View events:
https://my.wallarm.com/search?q=attacks&time_from=XXXXXXXXXX&time_to=XXXXXXXXXX

Client: TestCompany
Cloud: EU
```

* `Notification about SQLi hits` is the trigger name
* `TestCompany` is the name of your company account in Wallarm Console
* `EU` is the Wallarm Cloud where your company account is registered

### Slack and email notification if new user is added to the account

If a new user with the **Administrator** or **Analyst** role is added to the company account in Wallarm Console, notification about this event will be sent to the email address specified in the integration and to the Slack channel.

![Example of a trigger sending the notification to Slack and by email](../../images/user-guides/triggers/trigger-example2.png)

**To test the trigger:**

1. Open the Wallarm Console → **Settings** → **Users** and add a new user. For example:

    ![Added user](../../images/user-guides/settings/integrations/webhook-examples/adding-user.png)
2. Open your email Inbox and check that the following message received:

    ![Email about new user added](../../images/user-guides/triggers/test-new-user-email-message.png)
3. Open the Slack channel and check that the following notification from the user **wallarm** received:

    ```
    [Wallarm] Trigger: New user was added to the company account
    
    Notification type: create_user
    
    A new user John Smith <johnsmith@example.com> with the role Analyst was added to the company account by John Doe <johndoe@example.com>.
    This notification was triggered by the "Added user" trigger.

    Client: TestCompany
    Cloud: EU
    ```

    * `John Smith` and `johnsmith@example.com` is information about the added user
    * `Analyst` is the role of the added user
    * `John Doe` and `johndoe@example.com` is information about the user who added a new user
