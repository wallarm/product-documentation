# Checking Attacks

In Wallarm Console, you can check detected attacks in the **Attacks** section.

## Attack list

The attack list presents data on attacks for the selected period (today's attacks by default), including the number of unique [malicious payload](../../glossary-en.md#malicious-payload), blocking status (depends on the [traffic filtration mode](../../admin-en/configure-wallarm-mode.md)),  [verification status](#verifying-attacks), and other data.

![Attacks tab][img-attacks-tab]

Note that you [can use][use-search] search field and filters as alternatives.

## Grouping of hits

When forming the attack list, Wallarm groups [hits](../../glossary-en.md#hit) sent from the same IP address into one attack. If grouped hits have different attack types, malicious payloads and URLs, attack parameters will be marked with the `[multiple]` tag in the attack list.

Grouping is by default enabled in Wallarm Console â†’ **Triggers** with the **Hits from the same IP** default trigger which activates when a single IP address originates more than 50 hits within 15 minutes.

![Example of a trigger for hit grouping](../../images/user-guides/triggers/trigger-example-group-hits.png)

You can adjust grouping under your needs: do this by creating your custom triggers of the **Hits from the same IP** type. Creating any custom trigger deletes the default one, if you delete all your custom triggers, the default is restored. You can also pause grouping by temporary disabling the default trigger.

## Attack details

Expand an attack to get the list of included requests and general attack details.

![Requests in the event][img-analyze-attack]

You can quickly create [rules](../rules/rules.md) to handle similar requests in future. Expand a request inside an attack to view it in a raw format.

![Raw format of the request][img-analyze-attack-raw]

<!--## Analyze requests from denylisted IPs

[Denylisting](../../user-guides/ip-lists/overview.md) proves to be an effective defensive measure against high-volume attacks of different types. This is achieved by blocking requests at the earliest stage of processing. At the same time, it is equally important to gather comprehensive information on all blocked requests for further analysis.

Wallarm offers the ability to collect and display statistics regarding blocked requests from denylisted source IPs. This empowers you to evaluate the potency of attacks originating from denylisted IPs, and conduct precise analysis of the requests from these IPs, exploring various parameters.

!!! info "Feature availability"
    Feature is available starting from node version 4.8, for NGINX-based nodes. By default it is [enabled](../../admin-en/configure-parameters-en.md#wallarm_acl_export_enable).
    
In Wallarm, there are several ways for IP to get into the denylist. Depending on the way used, you will need to [search](../../user-guides/search-and-filters/use-search.md#search-by-attack-type) for the associated events using different tags/filters:

* You add it manually (in the **Attacks** section, use `blocked_source` search or `Blocked Source` filter)
* It performs a behavioral attack and is automatically denylisted by:
    * [API Abuse Prevention](../../api-abuse-prevention/overview.md) module (`api_abuse`, `account_takeover`, `scraping` and `security_crawlers` search keys, the appropriate **Type** filters)
    * [`Brute force`](../../admin-en/configuration-guides/protecting-against-bruteforce.md) trigger (`brute`, `Brute force`)
    * [`Forced browsing`](../../admin-en/configuration-guides/protecting-against-bruteforce.md) trigger (`dirbust`, `Forced browsing`)
    * [`BOLA`](../../admin-en/configuration-guides/protecting-against-bola.md) trigger (`bola`, `BOLA`)
    * `Number of malicious payloads` trigger (`multiple_payloads`, `Multiple payloads`)

The listed behavioral attacks can be detected only after accumulating certain statistics the required amount of which depends on the corresponding trigger thresholds. Thus, in the first stage, before denylisting, Wallarm collects this information but all requests are passed and displayed within the `Monitoring` events.

Once trigger thresholds are exceeded, malicious activity is considered to be detected, and Wallarm places the IP in the denylist, the node starts immediate blocking of all requests originating from them.

As soon as sending of information about requests from denylisted IPs is enabled, you will see `Blocked` requests from these IPs in the event list. This applies to manually denylisted IPs as well.

![Events related to denylisted IPs - sending data enabled](../../images/user-guides/events/events-denylisted-export-enabled.png)

Note that search/filters will display both `Monitoring` and - if sending information is enabled - `Blocked` events for each attack type. For manually denylisted IPs a `Monitoring` event never exists.

Within the `Blocked` events, use tags to switch to the reason of denylisting - BOLA settings, API Abuse Prevention, trigger or causing record in denylist.

## Sampling of hits

When forming the attack details, Wallarm automatically makes information about attack more comfortable for analysis by displaying only unique [hits](../../about-wallarm/protecting-against-attacks.md#what-is-attack-and-what-are-attack-components) - non-unique (comparable and identical) hits are dropped from uploading to the Wallarm Cloud and not displayed. This process is called hit **sampling**.

Hit sampling does not affect the quality of attack detection but helps to avoid its slowdown. Wallarm node continues attack detection and [blocking](../../admin-en/configure-wallarm-mode.md#available-filtration-modes) even with hit sampling enabled.

The **Hits sampling is enabled** notification shows that sampling works now. You can click this notification or add [`sampled`](../search-and-filters/use-search.md#search-for-sampled-hits) to the search field to see only attacks that sampling was applied to. In the attack details you will see how many similar hits were detected but not displayed:

![Dropped hits](../../images/user-guides/events/bruteforce-dropped-hits.png)

!!! info "Displaying dropped hits in the attack list"
    Since dropped hits are not uploaded to the Wallarm Cloud, certain hits or whole attacks can be absent in the list of attacks.

Since dropped requests are still requests processed by the Wallarm node, the RPS value in the node details UI increases with each dropped request. The number of requests and hits on the [Threat Prevention dashboard](../dashboards/threat-prevention.md) also includes the number of dropped hits.

**When hit sampling is enabled**

* For [input validation attacks](../../about-wallarm/protecting-against-attacks.md#input-validation-attacks), hit sampling is disabled by default. If the percentage of attacks in your traffic is high, hit sampling is performed in two sequential stages: **extreme** and **regular**.
* For [behavioral attacks](../../about-wallarm/protecting-against-attacks.md#behavioral-attacks), attacks of the [Data bomb](../../attacks-vulns-list.md#data-bomb) and [Resource overlimiting](../../attacks-vulns-list.md#overlimiting-of-computational-resources): the **regular** sampling algorithm is enabled by default. **Extreme** sampling starts only if the percentage of attacks in your traffic is high.
* For events from denylisted IPs, sampling is configured on the node side. It uploads only the first 10 identical requests to the Cloud while applying a sampling algorithm to the rest of the hits.

When the sampling algorithm is enabled, in the **Attacks** section, the **Hits sampling is enabled** notification is displayed.

Sampling will be automatically disabled once the percentage of attacks in the traffic decreases.

**How hit sampling works**

Hit sampling is performed in two sequential stages: **extreme** and **regular**.

Regular algorithm processes only hits saved after the extreme stage, unless hits are of the [behavioral](../../about-wallarm/protecting-against-attacks.md#behavioral-attacks), [Data bomb](../../attacks-vulns-list.md#data-bomb) or [Resource overlimiting](../../attacks-vulns-list.md#overlimiting-of-computational-resources) types. If extreme sampling is disabled for hits of these types, the regular algorithm processes the original hit set.

**Extreme sampling**

The extreme sampling algorithm has the following core logic:

* If hits are of the [input validation](../../about-wallarm/protecting-against-attacks.md#input-validation-attacks) type, the algorithm uploads to the Cloud only those with unique [malicious payloads](../../about-wallarm/protecting-against-attacks.md#what-is-attack-and-what-are-attack-components). If several hits with the same payload are detected within an hour, only the first of them is uploaded to the Cloud and the others are dropped.
* If hits are of the [behavioral](../../about-wallarm/protecting-against-attacks.md#behavioral-attacks), [Data bomb](../../attacks-vulns-list.md#data-bomb) or [Resource overlimiting](../../attacks-vulns-list.md#overlimiting-of-computational-resources) types, the algorithm uploads to the Cloud only the first 10% of them detected within an hour.

**Regular sampling**

The regular sampling algorithm has the following core logic:

1. The first 5 identical hits for each hour are saved in the sample in the Wallarm Cloud. The rest of the hits are not saved in the sample, but their number is recorded in a separate parameter.

    The hits are identical if all of the following parameters have the same values:

    * Attack type
    * Parameter with the malicious payload
    * Target address
    * Request method
    * Response code
    * Originating IP address
2. Hit samples are grouped into [attacks](../../about-wallarm/protecting-against-attacks.md#what-is-attack-and-what-are-attack-components) in the event list.


## False positives

False positive occurs when attack signs are detected in the legitimate request. To prevent the filtering node from recognizing such requests as attacks in future, you can mark all or specific requests of the attack as false positives.

If a false positive mark is added for the attack of the type different from [information exposure](../../attacks-vulns-list.md#information-exposure), the rule disabling analysis of the same requests for detected [attack signs](../../about-wallarm/protecting-against-attacks.md#library-libproton)) is automatically created. Note that it is not displayed Wallarm Console.

<!--If a false positive mark is added for the incident with the [Information Exposure](../../attacks-vulns-list.md#information-exposure) attack type, the rule disabling analysis of the same requests for detected [vulnerability signs](../../about-wallarm/detecting-vulnerabilities.md#vulnerability-detection-methods) is automatically created.
-->
You can undo a false positive mark only within a few seconds after the mark was applied. If you decided to undo it later, this can be done only by sending a request to [Wallarm technical support](mailto: support@wallarm.com).

The default view of the attack list presents only actual attacks (without false positives) - to change that, under **All attacks** switch from **Default view** to **With false positives** or **Only false positives**.

![False positive filter](../../images/user-guides/events/filter-for-falsepositive.png)

## Verifying attacks

Wallarm automatically [rechecks](../../about-wallarm/detecting-vulnerabilities.md#active-threat-verification) attacks for active vulnerability detection (**Active verification**).

![Attacks with various verification statuses][img-verification-statuses]

Verification statuses:

* ![Happening now][img-happening-icon] **Happening now**: the attack is happening now; it will be verified when finished.
* ![Verified][img-verified-icon] **Verified**: the attack has been verified.
* ![Error][img-error-icon] **Error**: an attempt to verify an attack type that does not support verification:

    * [Brute-force][al-brute-force-attack]
    * [Forced browsing][al-forced-browsing]
    * [BOLA][al-bola]
    * Attacks with a request processing limit
    * Attacks for which the vulnerabilities have already been closed
    * Attacks that do not contain enough data for verification
    * [Attacks that consist of hits grouped by originating IPs](../../admin-en/configuration-guides/protecting-with-thresholds.md)

* ![Skipped][img-skip-icon] **Skipped**: an attempt to verify an attack type has been skipped. Possible reasons:

    * Attacks sent via the gRPC or Protobuff protocol
    * Attacks sent via the HTTP protocol of the version different from 1.x
    * Attacks sent via the method different from one of the following: GET, POST, PUT, HEAD, PATCH, OPTIONS, DELETE, LOCK, UNLOCK, MOVE, TRACE
    * Failed to reach an address of an original request
    * Attack signs are in the `HOST` header
    * [Request element](../rules/request-processing.md) containing attack signs is different from one of the following: `uri` , `header`, `query`, `post`, `path`, `action_name`, `action_ext`

* ![Sheduled][img-sheduled-icon] **Scheduled**: the attack is queued for verification. To raise the priority of the attack verification in the queue, click the verification icon and then **Force verification**.
* ![Forced][img-forced-icon] **Forced**: the attack has a raised priority in the verification queue.
* ![Could not connect][img-cloud-icon] **Could not connect to the server**: it is not possible to access the server at this time.

## API calls to get attacks

To get the attack details, you can [call the Wallarm API directly](../../api/overview.md) besides using the Wallarm Console UI. Below is the example of the API call for **getting the first 50 attacks detected in the last 24 hours**.

Please replacing `TIMESTAMP` with the date 24 hours ago converted to the [Unix Timestamp](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/) format.

--8<-- "../include/api-request-examples/get-attacks-en.md"

!!! warning "Getting 100 or more attacks"
    For attack and hit sets containing 100 or more records, it is best to retrieve them in smaller pieces rather than fetching large datasets all at once, in order to optimize performance.
