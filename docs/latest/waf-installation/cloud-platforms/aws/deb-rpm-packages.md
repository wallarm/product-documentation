# Installation of the filtering node from DEB or RPM packages on AWS

This quick guide provides the steps to install the filtering node from the source packages on a separate Amazon EC2 instance. By following this guide, you will create an instance from the supported operating system image and install the Wallarm filtering node on this operating system.

!!! warning "The instructions limitations"
    These instructions do not cover the configuration of load balancing and node autoscaling. If setting up these components yourself, we recommend that you review the [AWS instructions on the Elastic Load Balancing service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/what-is-load-balancing.html).

## Requirements

* AWS account and user with the **admin** permissions
* Access to the account with the **Administrator** role in Wallarm Console for the [EU Cloud](https://my.wallarm.com/) or [US Cloud](https://us1.my.wallarm.com/)

## Filtering node installation options

Since the filtering node operates as the web server or API gateway module, web server or API gateway packages should be installed on the operating system along with the filtering node packages.

You can select the web server or API gateway that is the most suitable for your application architecture from the following list:

* [Install the filtering node as the NGINX Stable module](#installing-the-filtering-node-as-the-nginx-stable-module)
* [Install the filtering node as the NGINX Plus module](#installing-the-filtering-node-as-the-nginx-plus-module)
* [Install the filtering node as the Kong module](#installing-the-filtering-node-as-the-kong-module)

## Installing the filtering node as the NGINX Stable module
