# Deploying Wallarm as a Connector

API deployment can be done in various ways, including utilizing external tools such as Azion Edge, Akamai Edge, MuleSoft, Apigee, and CloudFront. If you are looking for a way to secure these APIs with Wallarm, we offer a solution in the form of "connectors" specifically designed for such cases.

## How it works

Wallarm's connector solution integrates with third-party platforms, such as API gateways or edge platforms, to filter and analyze traffic. The solution operates with two main components:

* The **Wallarm node**, hosted either by [Wallarm](../security-edge/se-connector.md) or the client, performs traffic analysis and security checks.
* A **Wallarm-provided code bundle or policy** which is injected into the third-party platform to route traffic for analysis to the Wallarm node.

With connectors, traffic can be analyzed either [in-line](../inline/overview.md) or [out-of-band](../oob/overview.md):

=== "In-line traffic flow"

    If Wallarm is configured to [block](../../admin-en/configure-wallarm-mode.md) malicious activity:

=== "Out-of-band traffic flow"
