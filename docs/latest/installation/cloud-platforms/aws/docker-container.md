# Deployment of the Wallarm Docker Image to AWS

This quick guide provides the steps to deploy the [Docker image of the NGINX-based Wallarm node](https://hub.docker.com/r/wallarm/node) to the Amazon cloud platform using the [Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/deploy-docker-containers/).

!!! warning "The instructions limitations"
    These instructions do not cover the configuration of load balancing and node autoscaling. If setting up these components yourself, we recommend that you review an appropriate part of the [AWS instructions](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/deploy-docker-containers/).

## Requirements

* AWS account and user with the **admin** permissions
* AWS CLI 1 or AWS CLI 2 properly [installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) and [configured](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html)
* Access to the account with the **Administrator** role in Wallarm Console for the [US Cloud](https://us1.my.wallarm.com/) or [EU Cloud](https://my.wallarm.com/)

## Deploying the Wallarm node Docker container configured through environment variables

To deploy the containerized Wallarm filtering node configured only through environment variables, the AWS Management Console and AWS CLI are used.

1. Sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home) → the **Services** list → **Elastic Container Service**.
1. Proceed to cluster creation by the button **Create Cluster**:
      1. Select the template **EC2 Linux + Networking**.
      2. Specify the cluster name, for example: `wallarm-cluster`.
      3. If required, set other settings following the [AWS instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/create_cluster.html).
      4. Save the cluster.
1. Encrypt the sensitive data required to connect to the Wallarm Cloud (node token) by using the [AWS Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/tutorials_basic.html) or [AWS Systems Manager → Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-paramstore-su-create.html).

    In these instructions, sensitive data is stored in the AWS Secrets Manager.

    !!! warning "Access to the sensitive data storage"
        To allow the Docker container to read the encrypted sensitive data, please ensure the AWS settings meet the following requirements:
        
        * Sensitive data is stored in the region used to run the Docker container.
        * The IAM policy **SecretsManagerReadWrite** is attached to the user specified in the `executionRoleArn` parameter of the task definition. [More details on the IAM policies setup →](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access_identity-based-policies.html)
1. Create the following local JSON file with the [task definition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definitions.html) (task definition sets the Docker container operating scenario):

## Deploying the Wallarm node Docker container configured through the mounted file

To deploy the containerized Wallarm filtering node configured through environment variables and mounted file, the AWS Management Console and AWS CLI are used.

In these instructions, the configuration file is mounted from the [AWS EFS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/whatisefs.html) file system. You can review other methods for mounting the file in the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using_data_volumes.html).

To deploy the container with environment variables and configuration file mounted from AWS EFS:

--8<-- "../include/waf/installation/get-api-or-node-token.md"

1. Sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home) → the **Services** list → **Elastic Container Service**.
1. Proceed to cluster creation by the button **Create Cluster**:

    * **Template**: `EC2 Linux + Networking`.
    * **Cluster name**: `wallarm-cluster` (as an example).
    * **Provisioning Model**: `On-Demand Instance`.
    * **EC2 instance type**: `t2.micro`.
    * **Number of instances**: `1`.
    * **EC2 AMI ID**: `Amazon Linux 2 Amazon ECS-optimized AMI`.
    * **Key pair**: [key pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html) for SSH connection to the instance. You will need to connect to the instance via SSH to upload the configuration file to the storage.
   * Other settings can be left as default. When changing other settings, it is recommended to follow the [instructions on AWS EFS setup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/tutorial-efs-volumes.html).
1. Configure the AWS EFS storage following steps 2-4 of the [AWS instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/tutorial-efs-volumes.html).
1. In the 4th step of AWS instructions, create the configuration file `default` and place the file in the directory that stores the files for mounting by default. The file `default` should cover the filtering node configuration. An example of the file with minimal settings:

    ```bash
    server {
        listen 80 default_server;
        listen [::]:80 default_server ipv6only=on;
        #listen 443 ssl;

        server_name localhost;

        #ssl_certificate cert.pem;
        #ssl_certificate_key cert.key;

        root /usr/share/nginx/html;

        index index.html index.htm;

        wallarm_mode monitoring;
        # wallarm_application 1;

        location / {
                proxy_pass http://example.com;
                include proxy_params;
        }
    }
    ```

## Testing the filtering node operation

1. In the AWS Management Console, open the running task and copy the container IP address from the field **External Link**.

    ![!Settig up container instance][aws-copy-container-ip-img]

    If the IP address is empty, please ensure the container is in the **RUNNING** status.

2. Send the request with the test [Path Traversal][ptrav-attack-docs] attack to the copied address:

    ```
    curl http://<COPIED_IP>/etc/passwd
