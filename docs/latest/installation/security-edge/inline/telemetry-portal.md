# Telemetry Portal for Security Edge Inline <a href="../../../../about-wallarm/subscription-plans/#security-edge-paid-plan"><img src="../../../../images/security-edge-tag.svg" style="border: none;"></a>

The telemetry portal for [Security Edge Inline](overview.md) provides a Grafana dashboard with real-time insights into metrics on traffic processed by Wallarm.

The dashboard displays key metrics such as total processed requests, RPS, detected and blocked attacks, deployed Edge Node number, resource consumption, number of 5xx responses, etc.

**Run telemetry portal** once the Node reaches the [**Active** status](upgrade-and-management.md#statuses). It becomes accessible via a direct link from the Security Edge section ~5 minutes after initiation.
