# Deploying Kong Ingress Controller with Integrated Wallarm Services

To secure APIs managed by Kong API Gateway, you can deploy the Kong Ingress controller with integrated Wallarm services in a Kubernetes cluster. The solution involves the default Kong API Gateway functionality with the layer of real-time malicious traffic mitigation.

The solution is deployed from the [Wallarm Helm chart](https://github.com/wallarm/kong-charts).

The **key features** of the Kong Ingress Controller with integrated Wallarm services:

* Real-time [attack detection and mitigation][attack-detection-docs]
* [Vulnerability detection][vulnerability-detection-docs]
* [API inventory discovery][api-discovery-docs]
* The Wallarm services are integrated natively into both the Open-Source and Enterprise [Kong API Gateway](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/) editions
* This solution is based on the [official Kong Ingress Controller for Kong API Gateway](https://docs.konghq.com/kubernetes-ingress-controller/latest/) that provides full support for features of Kong API Gateway
* Support for Kong API Gateway 3.1.x (for both the Open-Source and Enterprise editions)
* Fine-tuning the Wallarm layer via the Wallarm Console UI and on a per-Ingress basis via annotations

    !!! warning "Annotation support"
        Ingress annotation is supported only by the solution based on the Open-Source Kong Ingress controller. [The list of supported annotations is limited](customization.md#fine-tuning-of-traffic-analysis-via-ingress-annotations-only-for-the-open-source-edition).
* Provides a dedicated entity for the postanalytics module that is the local data analytics backend for the solution consuming most of the CPU

## Use cases

Among all supported [Wallarm deployment options][deployment-platform-docs], this solution is the recommended one for the following **use cases**:

* There is no Ingress controller and security layer routing traffic to Ingress resources managed by Kong.
* You are using either the Open-Source or Enterprise official Kong Ingress controller and looking for a security solution compatible with your technology stack.

    You can seamlessly replace the deployed Kong Ingress Controller with the one these instructions describe by only moving your configuration to a new deployment.

## Solution architecture

The solution has the following architecture:

![!Solution architecture][kong-ing-controller-scheme]

The solution is based on the official Kong Ingress Controller, its architecture is described in the [official Kong documentation](https://docs.konghq.com/kubernetes-ingress-controller/latest/concepts/design/).

Kong Ingress Controller with integrated Wallarm services is arranged by the following Deployment objects:

* **Ingress controller** (`wallarm-ingress-kong`) that injects the Kong API Gateway and Wallarm resources into the K8s cluster configuring it based on the Helm chart values and connecting the node components to the Wallarm Cloud.
* **Postanalytics module** (`wallarm-ingress-kong-wallarm-tarantool`) is the local data analytics backend for the solution. The module uses the in-memory storage Tarantool and the set of some helper containers (like the collectd, attack export services).

## Limitations of the Enterprise Kong Ingress controller

The described solution for the Enterprise Kong Ingress controller allows the Wallarm layer fine‑tuning only via the Wallarm Console UI.

However, some features of the Wallarm platform require configuration files to be changed that is unsupported in the current Enterprise solution implementation. It makes the following Wallarm features unavailable:

* [Multitenancy feature][multitenancy-overview]
* [Application configuration][applications-docs]
* [Custom blocking page and code setup][custom-blocking-page-docs] - not supported by both the Enterprise and Open-Source Kong Ingress controllers with Wallarm services

As for the Open-Source Kong Ingress controller with Wallarm services, it supports the multitenancy and application configuration on a per-Ingress basis via [annotations](customization.md#fine-tuning-of-traffic-analysis-via-ingress-annotations-only-for-the-open-source-edition).

### Step 2: Deploy the Wallarm Helm chart

1. Add the [Wallarm chart repository](https://charts.wallarm.com/):
    ```
    helm repo add wallarm https://charts.wallarm.com
    ```
1. Create the `values.yaml` file with the [solution configuration](customization.md).

    Example of the file with the minimum configuration to run the **Open-Source** Kong Ingress controller with integrated Wallarm services:

    === "US Cloud"
        ```yaml
        wallarm:
          token: "<NODE_TOKEN>"
          apiHost: us1.api.wallarm.com

        image:
          repository: wallarm/kong
        
        ingressController:
          enabled: true
          installCRDs: false
          image:
            repository: wallarm/kong-kubernetes-ingress-controller
        ```
    === "EU Cloud"
        ```yaml
        wallarm:
          token: "<NODE_TOKEN>"

        image:
          repository: wallarm/kong

        ingressController:
          enabled: true
          installCRDs: false
          image:
            repository: wallarm/kong-kubernetes-ingress-controller
        ```  
        
    Example of the file with the minimum configuration to run **Enterprise** Kong Ingress controller with integrated Wallarm services:

    === "US Cloud"
        ```yaml
        wallarm:
          token: "<NODE_TOKEN>"
          apiHost: us1.api.wallarm.com

        image:
          repository: wallarm/kong-ee-preview
          license_secret: "<KONG-ENTERPRISE-LICENSE>"
          vitals:
            enabled: false
          portal:
            enabled: false
          rbac:
            enabled: false

        enterprise:
          enabled: true

        ingressController:
          enabled: true
          installCRDs: false
          image:
            repository: kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller
        ```
    === "EU Cloud"
        ```yaml
        wallarm:
          token: "<NODE_TOKEN>"

        image:
          repository: wallarm/kong-ee-preview
          license_secret: "<KONG-ENTERPRISE-LICENSE>"
          vitals:
            enabled: false
          portal:
            enabled: false
          rbac:
            enabled: false

        enterprise:
          enabled: true
        
        ingressController:
          enabled: true
          installCRDs: false
          image:
            repository: kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller
        ```  
    
    * `<NODE_TOKEN>` is the Wallarm node token you copied from the Wallarm Console UI

        --8<-- "../include/waf/installation/info-about-using-one-token-for-several-nodes.md"
    
    * `<KONG-ENTERPRISE-LICENSE>` is the [Kong Enterprise License](https://github.com/Kong/charts/blob/master/charts/kong/README.md#kong-enterprise-license)
1. Deploy the Wallarm Helm chart:

    ``` bash
    helm install --version 4.6.1 <RELEASE_NAME> wallarm/kong -n <KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE> -f <PATH_TO_VALUES>
    ```

    * `<RELEASE_NAME>` is the name for the Helm release of the Kong Ingress Controller chart
    * `<KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE>` is the new namespace to deploy the Helm release with the Kong Ingress Controller chart
    * `<PATH_TO_VALUES>` is the path to the `values.yaml` file

### Step 3: Enable traffic analysis for your Ingress

If the deployed solution is based on the Open-Source Kong Ingress controller, enable traffic analysis for your Ingress by setting the Wallarm mode to `monitoring`:

```bash
kubectl annotate ingress <KONG_INGRESS_NAME> -n <KONG_INGRESS_NAMESPACE> wallarm.com/wallarm-mode=monitoring
```

Where `<KONG_INGRESS_NAME>` is the name of the K8s Ingress resource routing API calls to the microservices you want to protect.

As for the Enterprise Kong Ingress controller, traffic analysis in the monitoring mode is enabled globally for all Ingress resources by default.

### Step 4: Test Kong Ingress Controller with integrated Wallarm services

To test that Kong Ingress Controller with integrated Wallarm services operates correctly:

1. Get the Wallarm pod details to check they have been successfully started:

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n <NAMESPACE> -l app.kubernetes.io/name=kong
    ```

    Each pod should display the following: **READY: N/N** and **STATUS: Running**, e.g.:

    ```
    NAME                                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    wallarm-ingress-kong-54cf88b989-gp2vg                     1/1     Running   0          91m
    wallarm-ingress-kong-wallarm-tarantool-86d9d4b6cd-hpd5k   4/4     Running   0          91m
    ```
1. Send the test [Path Traversal][ptrav-attack-docs] attacks to the Kong Ingress Controller Service:

    ```bash
    curl http://<INGRESS_CONTROLLER_IP>/etc/passwd
    ```

    Since the Wallarm layer operates in the **monitoring** [filtration mode][available-filtration-modes-docs], the Wallarm node will not block the attack but will register it.

    To check that the attack has been registered, proceed to Wallarm Console → **Events**:

    ![!Attacks in the interface][attacks-in-ui-image]

## Customization

Wallarm pods have been injected based on the [default `values.yaml`](https://github.com/wallarm/kong-charts/blob/main/charts/kong/values.yaml) and the custom configuration you specified on the 2nd deployment step.

You can customize both the Kong API Gateway and Wallarm behavior even more and get the most out of Wallarm for your company.

Just proceed to the [Kong Ingress Controller solution customization guide](customization.md).
