# Customizing Wallarm Sidecar Proxy

This article instructs you on safe and effective customization of the [Wallarm Kubernetes Sidecar proxy solution](deployment.md) providing examples for some common customization use cases.

## Configuration area

The Wallarm Sidecar proxy solution is based on the standard Kubernetes components, thus the solution configuration is largely similar to the Kubernetes stack configuration. You can configure the Wallarm Sidecar proxy solution globally via `values.yaml` and on a per-application pod basis via annotations.

### Global settings

Global configuration options apply to all sidecar resources created by the Wallarm controller and are set in the [default Helm chart values](https://github.com/wallarm/sidecar/blob/main/helm/values.yaml). You can override them during `helm install` or `helm upgrade` by providing custom `values.yaml`.

The number of available global configuration options is unlimited. Care should be taken when customizing the solution since it allows complete change of the resulting Pod and improper solution function as a result. Please rely on the Helm and Kubernetes documentation when changing global settings.

[There is the list of Wallarm-specific chart values](helm-chart-for-wallarm.md)

### Per-pod settings

Per-pod settings allow customizing the solution behavior for certain applications.

Per-application pod settings are set via application Pod's annotations. Annotations take precedence over global settings. If the same option is specified globally and via the annotation, the value from the annotation will be applied.

The supported annotation set is limited but the `nginx-*-include` and `nginx-*-snippet` annotations allow any [custom NGINX configuration to be used by the solution](#using-custom-nginx-configuration).

[There is the list of supported per-pod's annotations](pod-annotations.md)

## Configuration use cases

As mentioned above, you can customize the solution in many ways to fit your infrastructure and requirements to the security solution. To make the most common customization options easier to implement, we have described them considering related best practices.

### Single and split deployment of containers

Wallarm provides two options for deployment of Wallarm containers to a Pod:

* Single deployment (by default)
* Split deployment

![!Single and split containers][single-split-containers-img]

You can set the container deployment options both on the global and per-pod basis:

* Globally by setting the Helm chart value `config.injectionStrategy.schema` to `single` (default) or `split`.
* On a per-pod basis by setting the appropriate application Pod's annotation `sidecar.wallarm.io/sidecar-injection-schema` to `"single"` or `"split"`.

!!! info "Postanalytics module"
    Please note that the postanalytics module container runs [separately](deployment.md#solution-architecture), the described deployment options are related only to other containers.

#### Single deployment (by default)

With the single deployment of Wallarm containers, only one container will run in a Pod, apart from the optional init container with **iptables**.

As a result, there are two running containers:

* `sidecar-init-iptables` is the init container running iptables. By default, this container starts but you can [disable it](#capturing-incoming-traffic-port-forwarding).
* `sidecar-proxy` runs NGINX proxy with the Wallarm modules and some helper services. All these processes are run and managed by [supervisord](http://supervisord.org/).

#### Split deployment

With the split deployment of Wallarm containers, two additional containers will run in a Pod, apart from two init containers.

This option moves all helper services out from the `sidecar-proxy` container and remains only NGINX services to be started by the container.

Split container deployment provides more granular control over resources consumed by NGINX and helper services. It is the recommended option for highly loaded applications where dividing the CPU/Memory/Storage namespaces between the Wallarm and helper containers is necessary.

As a result, there are four running containers:

* `sidecar-init-iptables` is the init container running iptables. By default, this container starts but you can [disable it](#capturing-incoming-traffic-port-forwarding).
* `sidecar-init-helper` is the init container with helper services tasked with connecting the Wallarm node to the Wallarm Cloud.
* `sidecar-proxy` is the container with NGINX services.
* `sidecar-helper` is the container with some other helper services.

### Application container port auto-discovery

The protected application port can be configured in many ways. To handle and forward incoming traffic properly, the Wallarm sidecar proxy must be aware of the TCP port the application container accepts incoming requests.

By default, the sidecar controller automatically discovers the port in the following priority order:

1. If the port is defined via the `sidecar.wallarm.io/application-port` pod's annotation, the Wallarm controller uses this value.
1. If there is the port defined under the `name: http` application container setting, the Wallarm controller uses this value.
1. If there is no port defined under the `name: http` setting, the Wallarm controller uses the port value found first in the application container settings.
1. If there are no ports defined in the application container settings, the Wallarm controller uses the value of `config.nginx.applicationPort` from the Wallarm Helm chart.

If application container port auto-discovery does not work as expected, explicitly specify the port using the 1st or the 4th option.

### Capturing incoming traffic (port forwarding)

By default, the Wallarm sidecar controller routes traffic as follows:

1. Captures incoming traffic coming to the attached Pod's IP and application container port.
1. Redirects this traffic to the sidecar proxy container using the built-in iptables features.
1. Sidecar proxy mitigates malicious requests and forwards legitimate traffic to the application container.

Incoming traffic capture is implemented using the init container running iptables which is the best practice for automatic port forwarding. This container is run as privileged, with the `NET_ADMIN` capability.

![!Default port forwarding with iptables][port-forwarding-with-iptables-img]

However, this approach is incompatible with the service mesh like Istio since Istio already has iptables-based traffic capture implemented. In this case, you can disable iptables and port forwarding will work as follows:

![!Port forwarding without iptables][port-forwarding-without-iptables-img]

!!! info "Unprotected application container"
    If iptables is disabled, an exposed application container will not be protected by Wallarm. As a result, malicious "east-west" traffic may reach the application container if its IP address and port are known to an attacker.

    East/west traffic is traffic flowing around the Kubernetes cluster (e.g. service-to-service).

You can change the default behavior as follows:

1. Disable iptables in one of the ways:

    * Globally by setting the Helm chart value `config.injectionStrategy.iptablesEnable` to `"false"`
    * On a per-pod basis by setting the Pod's annotation `sidecar.wallarm.io/sidecar-injection-iptables-enable` to `"false"`
2. Update the `spec.ports.targetPort` setting in your Service manifest to point to the `proxy` port.

    If iptables-based traffic capture is disabled, the Wallarm sidecar proxy container will publish a port with the name `proxy`. For incoming traffic to come from Kubernetes service to the `proxy` port, the `spec.ports.targetPort` setting in your Service manifest should point to this port:

```yaml hl_lines="16-17 34"
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp
  namespace: default
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:

      labels:
        app: myapp
        wallarm-sidecar: enabled
      annotations:
        sidecar.wallarm.io/sidecar-injection-iptables-enable: "false"
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: application
          image: kennethreitz/httpbin
          ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myapp-svc
  namespace: default
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: proxy
      protocol: TCP
      name: http
  selector:
    app: myapp
```

### Allocating resources for containers

The amount of memory allocated for the Wallarm sidecar containers determines the quality and speed of request processing. To allocate enough resources for memory requests and limits, [learn our recommendations][allocate-resources-for-node-docs].

Resource allocation is allowed on both the global and per-pod levels.

#### Global allocation via Helm chart values

| Container deployment pattern | Container name        | Chart value                                      |
|-------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| [Split, Single](#single-and-split-deployment-of-containers)     | sidecar-proxy         | config.sidecar.containers.proxy.resources        |
| Split             | sidecar-helper        | config.sidecar.containers.helper.resources       |
| Split, Single     | sidecar-init-iptables | config.sidecar.initContainers.iptables.resources |
| Split             | sidecar-init-helper   | config.sidecar.initContainers.helper.resources   |

Example of Helm chart values for managing resources (requests & limits) globally:

```yaml
config:
  sidecar:
    containers:
      proxy:
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 200m
            memory: 256Mi
          limits:
            cpu: 500m
            memory: 512Mi
      helper:
        resources:
          requests:
              cpu: 100m
              memory: 128Mi
            limits:
              cpu: 300m
              memory: 256Mi
    initContainers:
      helper:
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 100m
            memory: 64Mi
          limits:
            cpu: 300m
            memory: 128Mi
      iptables:
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 50m
            memory: 32Mi
          limits:
            cpu: 100m
            memory: 64Mi
```

#### Per-pod basis allocation via Pod's annotations

| Container deployment pattern | Container name        | Annotation                                                             |
|-------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Single, Split](#single-and-split-deployment-of-containers)     | sidecar-proxy         | sidecar.wallarm.io/proxy-{cpu,memory,cpu-limit,memory-limit}         |
| Split             | sidecar-helper        | sidecar.wallarm.io/helper-{cpu,memory,cpu-limit,memory-limit}        |
| Single, Split     | sidecar-init-iptables | sidecar.wallarm.io/init-iptables-{cpu,memory,cpu-limit,memory-limit} |
| Split             | sidecar-init-helper   | sidecar.wallarm.io/init-helper-{cpu,memory,cpu-limit,memory-limit}   |

Example of annotations to manage resources (requests & limits) on a per-pod basis (with the `single` container pattern enabled):

```yaml hl_lines="16-24"
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment

        sidecar.wallarm.io/init-iptables-cpu-limit: 100m
        sidecar.wallarm.io/init-iptables-memory: 32Mi
        sidecar.wallarm.io/init-iptables-memory-limit: 64Mi
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: application
          image: kennethreitz/httpbin
          ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: 80
```

### SSL/TLS termination

By default, the Sidecar proxy solution only accepts HTTP traffic and forwards plain HTTP traffic to the application pods. It is assumed that SSL/TLS termination is performed by an infrastructure component located before the sidecar solution (such as Ingress/Application Gateway), allowing the sidecar solution to process plain HTTP.

However, there may be cases where the existing infrastructure does not support SSL/TLS termination. In such cases, you can enable SSL/TLS termination at the Wallarm sidecar proxy level. This feature is supported starting from the Helm chart 4.6.1.

!!! warning "The Sidecar solution supports either SSL or plain HTTP traffic processing"
    The Wallarm Sidecar solution supports either SSL/TLS or plain HTTP traffic processing. Enabling SSL/TLS termination means that the sidecar solution will not process plain HTTP traffic, while disabling SSL/TLS termination will result in only HTTPS traffic being processed.

To enable SSL/TLS termination:

1. Obtain the server certificate (public key) and private key associated with the server for which the Sidecar proxy will terminate SSL/TLS.
1. In the namespace of the application pod, create a [TLS secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#tls-secrets) containing the server certificate and private key.
1. In the `values.yaml` file, add the `config.profiles section` for secret mounting. The example below shows multiple certificate mounting configurations.

    Customize the code based on the comments to meet your needs. Remove any unnecessary certificate mounting configurations if you only require one certificate.

    ```yaml
    config:
      wallarm:
        api:
          token: "<NODE_TOKEN>"
          host: "us1.api.wallarm.com" # or empty string if using the EU Cloud
        # Other Wallarm settings https://docs.wallarm.com/installation/kubernetes/sidecar-proxy/helm-chart-for-wallarm/
      profiles:
        tls-profile: # Set any desired TLS profile name here
          sidecar:
            volumeMounts:
              - name: nginx-certs-example-com # Name of the volume containing example.com keys
                mountPath: /etc/nginx/certs/example.com # Path to mount example.com keys in the container
                readOnly: true
              - name: nginx-certs-example-io # Name of the volume containing example.io keys
                mountPath: /etc/nginx/certs/example.io # Path to mount example.io keys in the container
                readOnly: true
            volumes:
              - name: nginx-certs-example-com # Name of the volume containing example.com keys
                secret:
                  secretName: example-com-certs # Name of the secret created for the example.com backend, containing public and private keys
              - name: nginx-certs-example-io # Name of the volume containing example.io keys
                secret:
                  secretName: example-io-certs # Name of the secret created for the example.io backend, containing public and private keys
          nginx:
            # NGINX SSL module configuration specific to your TLS/SSL termination procedure.
            # Refer to https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html.
            # This configuration is required for the Sidecar proxy to perform traffic termination.
            servers:
              - listen: "ssl http2"
                include:
                  - "server_name example.com www.example.com"
                  - "ssl_protocols TLSv1.3"
                  - "ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/certs/example.com/tls.crt"
                  - "ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/certs/example.com/tls.key"
                  - "ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384"
                  - "ssl_conf_command Ciphersuites TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256:TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384:TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256"
              - listen: "ssl"
                include:
                  - "server_name example.io www.example.io"
                  - "ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3"
                  - "ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/certs/example.io/tls.crt"
                  - "ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/certs/example.io/tls.key"
    ```
1. Apply the changes from `values.yaml` to the Sidecar proxy solution using the following command:

    ```bash
    helm upgrade <RELEASE_NAME> wallarm/wallarm-sidecar --wait -n <NAMESPACE> -f values.yaml
    ```
1. [Apply](pod-annotations.md#how-to-use-annotations) the `sidecar.wallarm.io/profile: tls-profile` annotation to the application pod.
1. Once the configuration is applied, you can test the solution by following the steps described [here](deployment.md#step-4-test-the-wallarm-sidecar-proxy-operation), replacing HTTP with HTTPS protocol.

The sidecar solution will accept TLS/SSL traffic, terminate it, and forward plain HTTP traffic to the application pod.

### Enabling additional NGINX modules

Docker image of the Wallarm sidecar proxy is distributed with the following additional NGINX modules disabled by default:

* [ngx_http_auth_digest_module.so](https://github.com/atomx/nginx-http-auth-digest)
* [ngx_http_brotli_filter_module.so](https://github.com/google/ngx_brotli)
* [ngx_http_brotli_static_module.so](https://github.com/google/ngx_brotli)
* [ngx_http_geoip2_module.so](https://github.com/leev/ngx_http_geoip2_module)
* [ngx_http_influxdb_module.so](https://github.com/influxdata/nginx-influxdb-module)
* [ngx_http_modsecurity_module.so](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity)
* [ngx_http_opentracing_module.so](https://github.com/opentracing-contrib/nginx-opentracing)

You can enable additional modules only on a per-pod basis by setting Pod's annotation `sidecar.wallarm.io/nginx-extra-modules`.

The format of annotation's value is an array. Example with additional modules enabled:

```yaml hl_lines="16-17"
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp
  namespace: default
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
        wallarm-sidecar: enabled
      annotations:
        sidecar.wallarm.io/nginx-extra-modules: "['ngx_http_brotli_filter_module.so','ngx_http_brotli_static_module.so', 'ngx_http_opentracing_module.so']"
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: application
          image: kennethreitz/httpbin
          ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: 80
```

### Using custom NGINX configuration

If there are no dedicated [pod annotations](pod-annotations.md) for some NGINX settings, you can specify them via per-pod **snippets** and **includes**.

#### Snippet

Snippets is a convenient way to add one-line changes to the NGINX configuration. For more complex changes, [includes](#include) is a recommended option.

To specify custom settings via snippets, use the following per-pod's annotations:

| NGINX config section | Annotation                                  | 
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| http                 | `sidecar.wallarm.io/nginx-http-snippet`     |
| server               | `sidecar.wallarm.io/nginx-server-snippet`   |
| location             | `sidecar.wallarm.io/nginx-location-snippet` |

Example of the annotation changing the [`disable_acl`][disable-acl-directive-docs] NGINX directive value:

```yaml hl_lines="18"
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp
  namespace: default
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
        wallarm-sidecar: enabled
      annotations:
        sidecar.wallarm.io/wallarm-mode: block
        sidecar.wallarm.io/nginx-location-snippet: "disable_acl on"
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: application
          image: kennethreitz/httpbin
          ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: 80
```

To specify more than one directive, use the `;` symbol, e.g.:

```yaml
sidecar.wallarm.io/nginx-location-snippet: "disable_acl on;wallarm_timeslice 10"
```

#### Include

To mount an additional NGINX configuration file to the Wallarm sidecar container, you can [create ConfigMap](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/#create-configmaps-from-files) or [Secret resource](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#creating-a-secret) from this file and use the created resource in the container.

Once the ConfigMap or Secret resource is created, you can mount it to the container via the [Volume and VolumeMounts components](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/#populate-a-volume-with-data-stored-in-a-configmap) by using the following per-pod's annotations:

| Item          |  Annotation                                    | Value type  |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Volumes       | `sidecar.wallarm.io/proxy-extra-volumes`       | JSON |
| Volume mounts | `sidecar.wallarm.io/proxy-extra-volume-mounts` | JSON |

Once the resource is mounted to the container, specify the NGINX context to add the configuration by passing the path to the mounted file in the corresponding annotation:

| NGINX config section | Annotation                                  | Value type |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------|
| http                 | `sidecar.wallarm.io/nginx-http-include`     | Array  |
| server               | `sidecar.wallarm.io/nginx-server-include`   | Array  |
| location             | `sidecar.wallarm.io/nginx-location-include` | Array  |

Below is the example with mounted configuration file included on the `http` level of NGINX config. This example assumes that the `nginx-http-include-cm` ConfigMap was created in advance and contains valid NGINX configuration directives.

```yaml hl_lines="16-19"
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp
  namespace: default
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:

      annotations:
        sidecar.wallarm.io/proxy-extra-volumes: "[{'name': 'nginx-http-extra-config', 'configMap': {'name': 'nginx-http-include-cm'}}]"
        sidecar.wallarm.io/proxy-extra-volume-mounts: "[{'name': 'nginx-http-extra-config', 'mountPath': '/nginx_include/http.conf', 'subPath': 'http.conf'}]"
        sidecar.wallarm.io/nginx-http-include: "['/nginx_include/http.conf']"
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: application
          image: kennethreitz/httpbin
          ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: 80
```

### Configuring Wallarm features

In addition to the listed general solution settings, we also recommend you to learn [best practices in Wallarm feature configuration][wallarm-deployment-best-practices-docs].

This configuration is performed via [annotations](pod-annotations.md) and the Wallarm Console UI.

## Other configurations via annotations

In addition to the listed configuration use cases, you can fine-tune the Wallarm sidecar proxy solution for application pods using many other annotations.

[There is the list of supported per-pod's annotations](pod-annotations.md)
