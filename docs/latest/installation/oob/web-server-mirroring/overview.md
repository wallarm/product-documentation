# Wallarm OOB for Traffic Mirrored by NGINX, Envoy and Similar

This article explains how to deploy Wallarm as the [OOB](../overview.md) solution if you choose to produce a traffic mirror by your NGINX, Envoy or similar solution.

Traffic mirroring can be implemented by configuring a web, proxy or similar server to copy incoming traffic to the Wallarm services for analysis. With this approach, typical traffic flow looks as follows:

## Deployment procedure

To deploy and configure Wallarm to analyze a traffic mirror, you need to:

1. Deploy the Wallarm node to your infrastructure by one of the following methods:

    * [To AWS using the Terraform module](../terraform-module/mirroring-by-web-server.md)
    * [To AWS using the Machine Image](aws-ami.md)
    * [To GCP using the Machine Image](gcp-machine-image.md)

    <!-- * [To a container-based environment using the NGINX-based Docker image](docker-image.md)
    * [On a machine with a Debian or Ubuntu OS from DEB/RPM packages](packages.md) -->

    !!! info "Support of mirrored traffic analysis"
        Only NGINX-based Wallarm nodes support mirrored traffic filtration.
1. Configure Wallarm to analyze the traffic copy - the instructions above are equiped with the required steps.
1. Configure your infrastructure to produce a copy of your incoming traffic and send the copy to a Wallarm node as to an additional backend.

    For configuration details, we recommend to refer to the documentation of components being used in your infrastructure. [Below](#configuration-examples-for-traffic-mirroring) we give configuration examples for some popular solutions like NGINX, Envoy and similar but the real configuration depends on the pecularities of your instrastructure.

## Configuration examples for traffic mirroring

Belowe are the examples on how to configure NGINX, Envoy, Traefik, Istio to mirror incoming traffic to Wallarm nodes as to an additional backend.

### NGINX

Starting with NGINX 1.13 you can mirror the traffic to an additional backend. For NGINX to mirror the traffic:

1. Configure the [`ngx_http_mirror_module`](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_mirror_module.html) module by setting the `mirror` directive in the `location` or `server` block.

    The example below will mirror requests received at `location /` to `location /mirror-test`.
1. To send the mirrored traffic to the Wallarm node, list the headers to be mirrored and specify the IP address of the machine with the node in the `location` the `mirror` directive points.

```
location / {
        mirror /mirror-test;
        mirror_request_body on;
        root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
        index  index.html index.htm; 
    }
    
location /mirror-test {
        internal;
        #proxy_pass http://111.11.111.1$request_uri;
        proxy_pass http://222.222.222.222$request_uri;
        proxy_set_header X-SERVER-PORT $server_port;
        proxy_set_header X-SERVER-ADDR $server_addr;
        proxy_set_header HOST $http_host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $realip_remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Port $realip_remote_port;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $http_x_forwarded_proto;
        proxy_set_header X-Scheme $scheme;
        proxy_set_header X-Request-ID $request_id;
    }
```

### Envoy

This example configures traffic mirroring with Envoy via the single `listener` listening to port 80 (without TLS) and having a single `filter`. Addresses of an original backend and additional backend receiving mirrored traffic are specified in the `clusters` block.

```yaml
static_resources:
  listeners:
  - address:
      socket_address:
        address: 0.0.0.0
        port_value: 80
    filter_chains:
    - filters:
        - name: envoy.filters.network.http_connection_manager
          typed_config:
            "@type": type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager
            stat_prefix: ingress_http
            codec_type: AUTO
            route_config:
              name: local_route
              virtual_hosts:
              - name: backend
                domains:
                - "*"
                routes:
                - match:
                    prefix: "/"
                  route:
                    cluster: httpbin     # <-- link to the original cluster
                    request_mirror_policies:
                    - cluster: wallarm   # <-- link to the cluster receiving mirrored requests
                      runtime_fraction:
                        default_value:
                          numerator: 100
            http_filters:
            - name: envoy.filters.http.router
              typed_config:
                "@type": type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.filters.http.router.v3.Router

  clusters:
  ### Definition of original cluster

  - name: httpbin
    type: STRICT_DNS
    lb_policy: ROUND_ROBIN
    load_assignment:
      cluster_name: httpbin

              ### Address of the original endpoint. Address is DNS name
              ### or IP address, port_value is TCP port number
              ###
              socket_address:
                address: httpbin # <-- definition of the original cluster
                port_value: 80

              ### the default value for other deployment options should be 80.
              ###
              socket_address:
                address: wallarm
                port_value: 8445
```

### Istio

For Istio to mirror the traffic, you can configure `VirtualService` for mirroring routes either to the internal endpoint (internal for Istio, e.g. hosted in Kubernetes) or to the external endpoint with `ServiceEntry`:

* To enable mirroring of in-cluster requests (e.g. between pods), add `mesh` to `.spec.gateways`.
* To enable mirroring of external requests (e.g. via LoadBalancer or NodePort service), configure the Istio `Gateway` component and add the name of the component to `.spec.gateways` of `VirtualService`. This option is presented in the example below.

```yaml
---
### Configuration of destination for mirrored traffic
###
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: ServiceEntry
metadata:
  name: wallarm-external-svc
spec:
  hosts:
    - some.external.service.tld # mirroring destination address
  location: MESH_EXTERNAL
  ports:
    - number: 8445 # mirroring destination port
      name: http
      protocol: HTTP
  resolution: DNS
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: httpbin
spec:
  hosts:
    - ...
  gateways:
    ### Name of istio `Gateway` component. Required for handling traffic from
    ### external sources
    ###
    - httpbin-gateway
    ### Special label, enables this virtual service routes to work with requests
    ### from Kubernetes pods (in-cluster communication not via gateways)
    ###
    - mesh
  http:
    - route:
        - destination:
            host: httpbin
            port:
              number: 80
          weight: 100
      mirror:
        host: some.external.service.tld # mirroring destination address
        port:
          number: 8445 # mirroring destination port
---
### For handling external requests
###
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: httpbin-gateway
spec:
  selector:
    istio: ingress
    app: istio-ingress
  servers:
  - port:
      number: 80
      name: http
      protocol: HTTP
    hosts:
    - "httpbin.local"
```

### Traefik

The following configuration example is based on the [`dynamic configuration file`](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/reference/dynamic-configuration/file/) approach. Traefik also supports other configuration modes, and you can easily adjust the provided one to any of them as they have a similar structure.

```yaml
### Dynamic configuration file
### Note: entrypoints are described in static configuration file
http:
  services:
    ### This is how to map original and wallarm `services`.
    ### In further `routers` configuration (see below), please 
    ### use the name of this service (`with_mirroring`).
    ###
    with_mirroring:
      mirroring:
        service: "httpbin"
        mirrors:
          - name: "wallarm"
            percent: 100

    ### The `service` to mirror traffic to - the endpoint
    ### that should receive the requests mirrored (copied)
    ### from the original `service`.
    ###
    wallarm:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: "http://wallarm:8445"

    ### Original `service`. This service should receive the
    ### original traffic.
    ###
    httpbin:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: "http://httpbin:80/"

  routers:
    ### The router name must be the same as the `service` name
    ### for the traffic mirroring to work (with_mirroring).
    ###
    with_mirroring:
      entryPoints:
        - "web"
      rule: "Host(`mirrored.example.com`)"
      service: "with_mirroring"

    ### The router for the original traffic.
    ###
    just_to_original:
      entryPoints:
        - "web"
      rule: "Host(`original.example.local`)"
      service: "httpbin"
```
