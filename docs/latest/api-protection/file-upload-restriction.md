<!--intro TBD-->

Wallarm provides the **File upload restriction policy** [mitigation control](../about-wallarm/mitigation-controls-overview.md).

## Creating and applying mitigation control

Before proceeding: use the [Mitigation Controls](../about-wallarm/mitigation-controls-overview.md#configuration) article to get familiar with how **Scope**, **Scope filters** and **Mitigation mode** are set for any mitigation control.

To configure file upload restriction policy:

1. Proceed to Wallarm Console → **Mitigation Controls**.
1. Use **Add control** → **File upload restriction policy**.
1. Describe the **Scope** to apply the mitigation control to.
1. Set **Size restrictions** for full request or its selected point.
1. In the **Mitigation mode** section, set action to be done.
1. Click **Add**.
