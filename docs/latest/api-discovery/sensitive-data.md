!!! warning "Newer version available"
    This article describes **REST only** API Discovery - since May 2025, the [newer version](../api-discovery-2.0/overview.md) supporting both **REST and GraphQL** and having **improved performance** is available.

API Discovery detects and highlights sensitive data consumed and carried by your APIs, which allows applying encryption, tokenization, or other security controls to protect it and prevent data breaches and transmitting sensitive data across insecure channels or to unauthorized systems. This article describes how to use and configure the feature.

You get Wallarm's sensitive data detection ready-to-use with the comprehensive default configuration. It is also highly customizable: you can fine-tune the existing detection process and extend it with your own data types to detect.

## Detection by default

By default, API Discovery detects the following types of sensitive data:

* Technical data like IP and MAC addresses
* Login credentials like secret keys and passwords
* Financial data like bank card numbers
* Medical data like medical license number
* Personally identifiable information (PII) like full name, passport number or SSN

In Wallarm Console, go to **API Discovery** → **Configure API Discovery** → **Sensitive data** to check the list of default [sensitive data patterns](#customizing-sensitive-data-detection) provided for each of listed types.

## Customizing sensitive data detection

To make sensitive data detection fully comply with your company's specific needs and industry-specific regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, etc., API Discovery provides the ability to fine-tune the detection process (requires NGINX Node 5.0.3 or Native Node 0.7.0 or higher).

Customization empowers you to meet your company's unique data protection obligations. Additionally, if any proprietary or specialized sensitive data elements are presented in your data flows, you will benefit from the ability to define custom regular expressions for their precise identification.

Sensitive data detection is configured with the set **sensitive data patterns** - each pattern defines specific sensitive data and settings for its search. API Discovery goes with the set of default patterns. You can modify default patterns and add your own in Wallarm Console → **API Discovery** → **Configure API Discovery** → **Sensitive data**.

You can modify or disable the default (out-of-box) patterns and quickly restore them to initial settings if necessary. Your own patterns can be created, modified, disabled and deleted at any moment.

**Confidence scores**

You can use patterns and context words to configure your sensitive data detection. Choose the confidence scores from `0.1` to `1.0` for your patterns and context words to specify how confident you are that matching this expression or the presence of the string or word next to the sensitive data means the presence of sensitive data. Use appropriate scores to detect more real entities and produce fewer false positives.

The sensitive data is detected if score threshold of `0.3` is reached or exceeded: the context word scores are summed up, from the patterns the biggest is taken. See examples below for better understanding.

You should adjust confidence scores after trying them on actual traffic data.

**Pattern-based detection**

Use a regular expression in [PCRE](https://www.pcre.org/) format to match the expected sensitive data value. When you use a regular expression, detection becomes much more precise. You can use several patterns with different scores. If any is matched, the sensitive data is detected.

Patterns are suitable for fixed-length tokens, IDs, and URIs.

**Context words**

Wallarm looks at the words around the suspected sensitive data that match the pattern. If any of the context words is found, it boosts the resulting confidence score. The context can come from URL path, query parameter name, JSON keys, and other parameters next to it.

For example, on the picture above, the sensitive data will be detected:

* Immediately if the match to `JWT` or `AWS access key ID` pattern is found.
* If the match to `AWS key (weak)` is found, by itself it will not result "yes" (score of `0.1` is below threshold of `0.3`).
* But with the context words `access` (`0.1`) and `api` (`0.1`) the sum becomes `0.3` and sensitive data is detected.
* If we mark `auth` as mandatory, the situation changes: in absence of `auth`, scores of presented `access` and `api` will be ignored and cannot boost the pattern's score.

**Context word only-based detection**

If you specify context words without patterns, Wallarm decides on sensitive data presence based on the presence of the words. The more the confidence scores sum, the more likely the parameter will be marked as having your described sensitive data.

For some context-only searches, it is necessary to declare some words as **mandatory**: if the mandatory word is not presented in the value's context, the parameter does not contain sensitive data.

Example: personal_name

Context words:

* name
* first
* middle

We must match `middle_name,` but not `name` or `middle`. So, we set a score for `name` to `0.1` so we will not match `name`. But we must give `middle` a big score of `0.5` because "middle_name" is a strong combination.

To prevent us from detecting "middle" without `name,` we mark `name` as mandatory for an entity. If `name` is not found, no sensitive data is detected.
