# Wallarm On-premise Deployment (Pilot)

Wallarm offers a pilot on-premise solution designed for partners, large enterprises, and any organization looking for a comprehensive on-premise security system. This offering allows for the integration of Wallarm's security infrastructure directly into their own environments. The article provides information on how to access and make use of this offering.

The Wallarm architecture is built around two main components:

* Filtering node: Deployed within your infrastructure, allowing for flexible deployment options to suit your needs.
* Wallarm Cloud: Traditionally hosted externally by Wallarm. In the on-premise deployment model, we offer a method for deploying Wallarm Cloud within your own infrastructure. This approach necessitates organizing the entire infrastructure due to the comprehensive nature of the service deployment. We simplify this process by providing a script that automatically initiates all required services.
