# Upgrading an EOL cloud node image

These instructions describe the steps to upgrade the end‑of‑life cloud node image (version 3.6 and lower) deployed on AWS or GCP up to 4.10.

--8<-- "../include/waf/upgrade/warning-deprecated-version-upgrade-instructions.md"

## Requirements

--8<-- "../include/waf/installation/basic-reqs-for-upgrades.md"

## Step 1: Inform Wallarm technical support that you are upgrading filtering node modules (only if upgrading node 2.18 or lower)

If upgrading the node 2.18 or lower, please inform [Wallarm technical support](mailto:support@wallarm.com) that you are upgrading filtering node modules up to the latest version and ask to enable new IP list logic for your Wallarm account. When new IP list logic is enabled, please ensure the section [**IP lists**](../../user-guides/ip-lists/overview.md) of Wallarm Console is available.

## Step 2: Disable the Threat Replay Testing module (only if upgrading node 2.16 or lower)

If upgrading Wallarm node 2.16 or lower, please disable the [Threat Replay Testing](../../about-wallarm/detecting-vulnerabilities.md#active-threat-verification) module in Wallarm Console → **Vulnerabilities** → **Configure**.

The module operation can cause [false positives](../../about-wallarm/protecting-against-attacks.md#false-positives) during the upgrade process. Disabling the module minimizes this risk.

## Step 3: Update API port

--8<-- "../include/waf/upgrade/api-port-443.md"

## Step 4: Review recent architectural updates

The latest update has introduced [architectural changes](what-is-new.md#optimized-cloud-images) that may impact users, especially those changing default configuration files of the node. Please familiarize yourself with these changes to ensure proper configuration and usage of the new image.

## Step 5: Launch a new instance with the filtering node 4.10

Copy the settings for processing and proxying requests from the following configuration files of the previous Wallarm node version to the files of the filtering node 4.10:

1. Open the Wallarm filtering node image on the cloud platform marketplace and proceed to the image launch:
      * [Amazon Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B073VRFXSD)
      * [GCP Marketplace](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/wallarm-node-195710/wallarm-node)
2. At the launch step, set the following settings:

      * Select the image version `4.10.x`
      * For AWS, select the [created security group](../../installation/cloud-platforms/aws/ami.md#2-create-a-security-group) in the field **Security Group Settings**
      * For AWS, select the name of the [created key pair](../../installation/cloud-platforms/aws/ami.md#1-create-a-pair-of-ssh-keys-in-aws) in the field **Key Pair Settings**
3. Confirm the instance launch.
4. For GCP, configure the instance following these [instructions](../../installation/cloud-platforms/gcp/machine-image.md#2-configure-the-filtering-node-instance).

## Step 6: Adjust Wallarm node filtration mode settings to changes released in the latest versions (only if upgrading node 2.18 or lower)

1. Ensure that the expected behavior of settings listed below corresponds to the [changed logic of the `off` and `monitoring` filtration modes](what-is-new.md#filtration-modes):
      * [Directive `wallarm_mode`](../../admin-en/configure-parameters-en.md#wallarm_mode)
      * [General filtration rule configured in Wallarm Console](../../admin-en/configure-wallarm-mode.md#general-filtration-rule-in-wallarm-console)
      * [Endpoint-targeted filtration rules configured in Wallarm Console](../../admin-en/configure-wallarm-mode.md#endpoint-targeted-filtration-rules-in-wallarm-console)
2. If the expected behavior does not correspond to the changed filtration mode logic, please adjust the filtration mode settings to released changes using the [instructions](../../admin-en/configure-wallarm-mode.md).

## Step 7: Connect the filtering node to Wallarm Cloud

1. Connect to the filtering node instance via SSH. More detailed instructions for connecting to the instances are available in the cloud platform documentation:
      * [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstances.html)
      * [GCP documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/connecting-to-instance)
2. Create a new Wallarm node and connect it to the Wallarm Cloud using the generated token as described in the instructions for the cloud platform:
      * [AWS](../../installation/cloud-platforms/aws/ami.md#6-connect-the-instance-to-the-wallarm-cloud)
      * [GCP](../../installation/cloud-platforms/gcp/machine-image.md#5-connect-the-instance-to-the-wallarm-cloud)

## Step 8: Copy the filtering node settings from the previous version to the new version

1. Copy the settings for processing and proxying requests from the following configuration files of the previous Wallarm node version to the files of the filtering node 4.10:
      * `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` and other files with NGINX settings
      * `/etc/nginx/conf.d/wallarm-status.conf` with the filtering node monitoring service settings

        Make sure the copied file contents correspond to the [recommended safe configuration](../../admin-en/configure-statistics-service.md#setup).

      * `/etc/environment` with environment variables
      * any other custom configuration files for request processing and proxying, taking into account the recent [architectural changes](what-is-new.md#optimized-cloud-images)
1. Rename the following NGINX directives if they are explicitly specified in configuration files:

    * `wallarm_instance` → [`wallarm_application`](../../admin-en/configure-parameters-en.md#wallarm_application)
    * `wallarm_local_trainingset_path` → [`wallarm_custom_ruleset_path`](../../admin-en/configure-parameters-en.md#wallarm_custom_ruleset_path)
    * `wallarm_global_trainingset_path` → [`wallarm_protondb_path`](../../admin-en/configure-parameters-en.md#wallarm_protondb_path)
    * `wallarm_ts_request_memory_limit` → [`wallarm_general_ruleset_memory_limit`](../../admin-en/configure-parameters-en.md#wallarm_general_ruleset_memory_limit)

    We only changed the names of the directives, their logic remains the same. Directives with former names will be deprecated soon, so you are recommended to rename them before.
1. If the [extended logging format](../../admin-en/configure-logging.md#filter-node-variables) is configured, please check if the `wallarm_request_time` variable is explicitly specified in the configuration.

      If so, please rename it to `wallarm_request_cpu_time`.

      We only changed the variable name, its logic remains the same. The old name is temporarily supported as well, but still it is recommended to rename the variable.
1. If upgrading node 2.18 or lower, [migrate](../migrate-ip-lists-to-node-3.md) allowlist and denylist configuration from previous Wallarm node version to 4.10.
1. If the page `&/usr/share/nginx/html/wallarm_blocked.html` is returned to blocked requests, [copy and customize](../../admin-en/configuration-guides/configure-block-page-and-code.md#customizing-sample-blocking-page) its new version.

      In the new node version, the Wallarm sample blocking page has [been changed](what-is-new.md#new-blocking-page). The logo and support email on the page are now empty by default.

Detailed information about working with NGINX configuration files is available in the [official NGINX documentation](https://nginx.org/docs/beginners_guide.html).

The list of filtering node directives is available [here](../../admin-en/configure-parameters-en.md).

## Step 8: Transfer the `overlimit_res` attack detection configuration from directives to the rule

--8<-- "../include/waf/upgrade/migrate-to-overlimit-rule-nginx.md"

## Step 9: Restart NGINX

Restart NGINX to apply the settings:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

## Step 10: Test Wallarm node operation

--8<-- "../include/waf/installation/test-waf-operation-no-stats.md"

## Step 11: Create the virtual machine image based on the filtering node 4.10 in AWS or GCP

To create the virtual machine image based on the filtering node 4.10, please follow the instructions for [AWS](../../admin-en/installation-guides/amazon-cloud/create-image.md) or [GCP](../../admin-en/installation-guides/google-cloud/create-image.md).

## Step 12: Delete the previous Wallarm node instance

If the new version of the filtering node is successfully configured and tested, remove the instance and virtual machine image with the previous version of the filtering node using the AWS or GCP management console.

## Step 13: Re-enable the Threat Replay Testing module (only if upgrading node 2.16 or lower)

Learn the [recommendation on the Threat Replay Testing module setup](../../vulnerability-detection/threat-replay-testing/setup.md) and re-enable it if required.

After a while, ensure the module operation does not cause false positives. If discovering false positives, please contact the [Wallarm technical support](mailto:support@wallarm.com).
