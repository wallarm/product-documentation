# Multi-Cloud and Multi-Region Deployment of Security Edge Inline <a href="../../../../about-wallarm/subscription-plans/#security-edge-paid-plan"><img src="../../../../images/security-edge-tag.svg" style="border: none;"></a>

You can deploy the inline Edge Nodes across multiple regions and cloud providers to achieve geo‑redundancy and low latency.

When [configuring Security Edge], you can select one or more regions across the supported cloud providers — **AWS** and **Azure**.

## Multi-region deployment

When selecting multiple regions within a single cloud provider, traffic is routed based on latency - each request goes to the nearest available region.

This is the most common setup, recommended when you serve requests from multiple locations.

## Multi-cloud deployment

When multiple regions across different cloud providers are selected, all requests are distributed across the selected regions and providers using a **[round‑robin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_DNS)** strategy, regardless of latency.

This setup is recommended in the following cases:

* Cloud provider redundancy - traffic is distributed across all selected providers, ensuring that if one becomes unavailable (e.g., AWS), others (e.g., Azure) continue handling traffic without disruption.
* Regional high availability - for example, selecting both `AWS US East 1` and `Azure East US` ensures traffic remains balanced across regions, and service continues even if one region or provider becomes unavailable.

## Wallarm IP ranges for origin access

Your [origin servers] must allow incoming traffic from the IP addresses used by the selected regions:

* AWS

    === "US East 1"

        ```

        104.211.29.72
        104.211.29.73
        ```
    === "East US 2"
        ```
        20.65.88.253
        20.65.88.252
        ```
    === "West US"
        ```
        104.210.63.116
        104.210.63.117
        ```
    === "West US 3"
        ```
        20.38.2.233
        20.38.2.232
        ```
    === "Germany West Central"
        ```
        20.79.250.104
        20.79.250.105
        ```
    === "Switzerland North"
        ```
        20.203.240.193
        20.203.240.192
        ```

## CNAME records

If your protected host is a third-level (or higher-level) domain (e.g., `api.example.com`), you need to [specify the CNAME record pointing to the Wallarm‑proided FQDN in your DNS zone]. This record is returned as the **Traffic CNAME**.

* Single cloud deployment: use the **Traffic CNAME for the selected cloud provider**.
* Multi-cloud deployment: use the **Traffic CNAME (Global)** to automatically distribute traffic across all selected regions and providers.

    Per-provider CNAMEs are also available if you need to enforce routing to a specific provider - for example, to test latency or performance across providers.

## A records

If your protected host is an apex domain (e.g., `example.com`), a CNAME cannot be used. In this case, the DNS setup must use **A records**, which are returned once the deployment becomes [**Active**].

If you have selected multiple regions or providers for Edge Node deployment, you need to configure all returned A records in your DNS zone.

Traffic routing in this case is managed by your DNS provider. By default, most DNS providers use [round-robin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_DNS) logic, but some may support latency-based routing as well.

## Removing a cloud provider or a region

* Before removing a cloud provider, switch your DNS setup to use the [per-provider Traffic CNAME].

    Once a provider is removed from the deployment, its CNAME becomes inactive.
* Before removing a region, update your [A records] accordingly.

    If a region is removed, the associated A records will no longer be available.
