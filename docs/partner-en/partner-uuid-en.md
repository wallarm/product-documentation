# Getting your UUID and Secret Key

After you sign up, [contact Wallarm Support](mailto:support@wallarm.com) and request to switch your regular account to the vendor account.

Once switched, Wallarm Support will provide you with the following:

* Your user UUID and secret key that you need to create tenants.
* Your vendor UUID that you need to tie tenants to you vendor account.
