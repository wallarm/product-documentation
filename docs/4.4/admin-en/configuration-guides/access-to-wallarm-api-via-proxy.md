# Access to Wallarm API via Proxy

These instructions describe the steps to configure access to Wallarm API via the proxy server.

* `https://api.wallarm.com/` for the EU Cloud
* `https://us1.api.wallarm.com/` for the US Cloud

To configure access, please assign new values to the environment variables defining the proxy server used in the `/etc/environment` file:

* `https_proxy` to define a proxy for the HTTPS protocol
* `http_proxy` to define a proxy for the HTTP protocol
* `no_proxy` to define the list of the resources proxy should not be used for

## https_proxy and http_proxy values

Assign the `<scheme>://<proxy_user>:<proxy_pass>@<host>:<port>` string values to the `https_proxy` and `http_proxy` variables:

* `<scheme>` defines the protocol used. It should match the protocol that the current environment variable sets up proxy for
* `<proxy_user>` defines the username for proxy authorization
* `<proxy_pass>` defines the password for proxy authorization
* `<host>` defines a host of the proxy server
* `<port>` defines a port of the proxy server

## no_proxy value

To the `no_proxy` variable, assign the array of IP addresses and/or domains of the resources which proxy should not be used for:

* `127.0.0.1`, `127.0.0.8`, `127.0.0.9` and `localhost` for correct Wallarm node operation
* additional addresses in the format: `"<res_1>, <res_2>, <res_3>, <res_4>, ..."` where `<res_1>`, `<res_2>`, `<res_3>`, and `<res_4>` are the IP addresses and/or domains

## Example of the file /etc/environment

An example of the file `/etc/environment` below demonstrates the following configuration:

* HTTPS and HTTP requests are proxied to the `1.2.3.4` host with the `1234` port, using the `admin` username and the `01234` password for authorization on the proxy server.
* Proxying is disabled for the requests sent to `127.0.0.1`, `127.0.0.8`, `127.0.0.9`, and `localhost`.

```bash
https_proxy=http://admin:01234@1.2.3.4:1234
http_proxy=http://admin:01234@1.2.3.4:1234
no_proxy="127.0.0.1, 127.0.0.8, 127.0.0.9, localhost"
```
