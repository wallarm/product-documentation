# Upgrading EOL Wallarm NGINX modules

These instructions describe the steps to upgrade the end‑of‑life Wallarm NGINX modules (version 3.6 and lower) to version 4.4. Wallarm NGINX modules are the modules installed in accordance with one of the following instructions:

* [NGINX `stable` module](../../installation/nginx/dynamic-module.md)
* [Module for NGINX from CentOS/Debian repositories](../../installation/nginx/dynamic-module-from-distr.md)
* [NGINX Plus module](../../installation/nginx-plus.md)

--8<-- "../include/waf/upgrade/warning-deprecated-version-upgrade-instructions.md"

## Requirements

--8<-- "../include/waf/installation/basic-reqs-for-upgrades.md"

## Upgrade procedure

* If filtering node and postanalytics modules are installed on the same server, then follow the instructions below to upgrade all packages.
* If filtering node and postanalytics modules are installed on different servers, **first** upgrade the postanalytics module following these [instructions](separate-postanalytics.md) and then perform the steps below for filtering node modules.

## Step 1: Inform Wallarm technical support that you are upgrading filtering node modules (only if upgrading node 2.18 or lower)

If upgrading node 2.18 or lower, inform [Wallarm technical support](mailto:support@wallarm.com) that you are updating filtering node modules up to the latest version and ask to enable new IP lists logic for your Wallarm account. When new IP lists logic is enabled, please open Wallarm Console and ensure that the section [**IP lists**](../../user-guides/ip-lists/overview.md) is available.

## Step 2: Disable the Active threat verification module (if upgrading node 2.16 or lower)

If upgrading Wallarm node 2.16 or lower, please disable the [Active threat verification](../../about-wallarm/detecting-vulnerabilities.md#active-threat-verification) module in Wallarm Console → **Scanner** → **Settings**.

The module operation can cause [false positives](../../about-wallarm/protecting-against-attacks.md#false-positives) during the upgrade process. Disabling the module minimizes this risk.

## Step 3: Update API port

--8<-- "../include/waf/upgrade/api-port-443.md"

## Step 4: Upgrade NGINX to the latest version

Upgrade NGINX to the latest version using the relevant instructions:

=== "NGINX stable"

    DEB-based distributions:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt -y install nginx
    ```

    RPM-based distributions:

    ```bash
    sudo yum update
    sudo yum install -y nginx
    ```
=== "NGINX Plus"
    For NGINX Plus, please follow the [official upgrade instructions](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/installing-nginx/installing-nginx-plus/#upgrading-nginx-plus).
=== "NGINX from Debian/CentOS repository"
    For NGINX [installed from Debian/CentOS repository](../../installation/nginx/dynamic-module-from-distr.md), please skip this step. The installed NGINX version will be upgraded [later](#step-7-upgrade-wallarm-packages) along with the Wallarm modules.

If your infrastructure needs to use a specific version of NGINX, please contact the [Wallarm technical support](mailto:support@wallarm.com) to build the Wallarm module for a custom version of NGINX.

## Step 5: Add new Wallarm repository

Delete the previous Wallarm repository address and add a repository with a new Wallarm node version package. Please use the commands for the appropriate platform.

**CentOS and Amazon Linux 2.0.2021x and lower**

=== "CentOS 7 and Amazon Linux 2.0.2021x and lower"
    ```bash
    sudo yum remove wallarm-node-repo
    sudo yum clean all
    sudo rpm -i https://repo.wallarm.com/centos/wallarm-node/7/4.4/x86_64/wallarm-node-repo-4.4-0.el7.noarch.rpm
    ```
=== "CentOS 8"
    !!! warning "Support for CentOS 8.x has been deprecated"
        Support for CentOS 8.x [has been deprecated](https://www.centos.org/centos-linux-eol/). You can install the Wallarm node on the AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux or Oracle Linux 8.x operating system insted.

        * [Installation instructions for NGINX `stable`](../../installation/nginx/dynamic-module.md)
        * [Installation instructions for NGINX from CentOS/Debian repositories](../../installation/nginx/dynamic-module-from-distr.md)
        * [Installation instructions for NGINX Plus](../../installation/nginx-plus.md)
=== "AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux or Oracle Linux 8.x"
    ```bash
    sudo yum remove wallarm-node-repo
    sudo yum clean all
    sudo rpm -i https://repo.wallarm.com/centos/wallarm-node/8/4.4/x86_64/wallarm-node-repo-4.4-0.el8.noarch.rpm
    ```

**Debian and Ubuntu**

1. Open the file with the Wallarm repository address in the installed text editor. In these instructions, **vim** is used.

    ```bash
    sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list.d/wallarm.list
    ```
2. Comment out or delete the previous repository address.
3. Add a new repository address:

    === "Debian 10.x (buster)"
        !!! warning "Unsupported by NGINX stable and NGINX Plus"
            Official NGINX versions (stable and Plus) and, as a result, Wallarm node 4.4 and above cannot be installed on Debian 10.x (buster). Please use this OS only if [NGINX is installed from Debian/CentOS repositories](../../installation/nginx/dynamic-module-from-distr.md).

        ```bash
        deb https://repo.wallarm.com/debian/wallarm-node buster/4.4/
        ```
    === "Debian 11.x (bullseye)"
        ```bash
        deb https://repo.wallarm.com/debian/wallarm-node bullseye/4.4/
        ```
    === "Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic)"
        ```bash
        deb https://repo.wallarm.com/ubuntu/wallarm-node bionic/4.4/
        ```
    === "Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal)"
        ```bash
        deb https://repo.wallarm.com/ubuntu/wallarm-node focal/4.4/
        ```

## Step 6: Migrate allowlists and denylists from the previous Wallarm node version to 4.4 (only if upgrading node 2.18 or lower)

If upgrading node 2.18 or lower, [migrate](../migrate-ip-lists-to-node-3.md) allowlist and denylist configuration from previous Wallarm node version to the latest version.

## Step 7: Upgrade Wallarm packages

### Filtering node and postanalytics on the same server

Execute the following command to upgrade the filtering node and postanalytics modules:

=== "Debian"
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt dist-upgrade
    ```

    --8<-- "../include/waf/upgrade/warning-expired-gpg-keys-4.4.md"

    --8<-- "../include/waf/upgrade/details-about-dist-upgrade.md"
=== "Ubuntu"
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt dist-upgrade
    ```

    --8<-- "../include/waf/upgrade/warning-expired-gpg-keys-4.4.md"

    --8<-- "../include/waf/upgrade/details-about-dist-upgrade.md"
=== "CentOS or Amazon Linux 2.0.2021x and lower"
    ```bash
    sudo yum update
    ```
=== "AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux or Oracle Linux 8.x"
    ```bash
    sudo yum update
    ```

### Filtering node and postanalytics on different servers

!!! warning "Sequence of steps to upgrade the filtering node and postanalytics modules"
    If the filtering node and postanalytics modules are installed on different servers, then it is required to upgrade the postanalytics packages before updating the filtering node packages.

1. Upgrade postanalytics packages following these [instructions](separate-postanalytics.md).
2. Upgrade Wallarm node packages:

    === "Debian"
        ```bash
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt dist-upgrade
        ```

        --8<-- "../include/waf/upgrade/warning-expired-gpg-keys-4.4.md"

        --8<-- "../include/waf/upgrade/details-about-dist-upgrade.md"
    === "Ubuntu"
        ```bash
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt dist-upgrade
        ```

        --8<-- "../include/waf/upgrade/warning-expired-gpg-keys-4.4.md"

        --8<-- "../include/waf/upgrade/details-about-dist-upgrade.md"
    === "CentOS or Amazon Linux 2.0.2021x and lower"
        ```bash
        sudo yum update
        ```
    === "AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux or Oracle Linux 8.x"
        ```bash
        sudo yum update
        ```
3. If the package manager asks for confirmation to rewrite the content of the configuration file `/etc/cron.d/wallarm-node-nginx`:

    1. Ensure that the [IP lists migration](#step-6-migrate-allowlists-and-denylists-from-previous-wallarm-node-version-to-42) is completed.
    2. Confirm the file rewrite by using the option `Y`.

        The package manager would ask for the rewrite confirmation if the file `/etc/cron.d/wallarm-node-nginx` had been [changed in the previous Wallarm node versions](/2.18/admin-en/configure-ip-blocking-nginx-en/). Since IP list logic was changed in Wallarm node 3.x, the `/etc/cron.d/wallarm-node-nginx` content was updated accordingly. For the IP address denylist to operate correctly, the Wallarm node 3.x should use the updated configuration file.

        By default, the package manager uses the option `N` but the option `Y` is required for the correct IP address denylist operation in Wallarm node 3.x.

## Step 8: Update the node type

The deployed node has the deprecated **regular** type that is [now replaced with the new **Wallarm node** type](what-is-new.md#unified-registration-of-nodes-in-the-wallarm-cloud-by-tokens).

It is recommended to install the new node type instead of the deprecated one during migration to the version 4.4. The regular node type will be removed in future releases, please migrate before.

!!! info "If the postanalytics module is installed on a separate server"
    If the initial traffic processing and postanalytics modules are installed on separate servers, it is recommended to connect these modules to the Wallarm Cloud using the same node token. The Wallarm Console UI will display each module as a separate node instance, e.g.:

    ![Node with several instances](../../images/user-guides/nodes/wallarm-node-with-two-instances.png)

    The Wallarm node has already been created during the [separate postanalytics module upgrade](separate-postanalytics.md). To connect the initial traffic processing module to the Cloud using the same node credentials:

    1. Copy the node token generated during the separate postanalytics module upgrade.
    1. Proceed to the 4th step in the list below.

To replace the regular node with the Wallarm node:

1. Open Wallarm Console → **Nodes** in the [US Cloud](https://us1.my.wallarm.com/nodes) or [EU Cloud](https://my.wallarm.com/nodes) and create the node of the **Wallarm node** type.

    ![Wallarm node creation][img-create-wallarm-node]
1. Copy the generated token.
1. Pause the NGINX service on the server with the node of the older version:

    === "Debian"
        ```bash
        sudo systemctl stop nginx
        ```
    === "Ubuntu"
        ```bash
        sudo service nginx stop
        ```
    === "CentOS or Amazon Linux 2.0.2021x and lower"
        ```bash
        sudo systemctl stop nginx
        ```
    === "AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux or Oracle Linux 8.x"
        ```bash
        sudo systemctl stop nginx
        ```

    The NGINX service pausing mitigates the risk of incorrect RPS calculation.
1. Execute the `register-node` script to run the **Wallarm node**:

    === "US Cloud"
        ``` bash
        sudo /usr/share/wallarm-common/register-node -t <NODE_TOKEN> -H us1.api.wallarm.com --force
        ```
    === "EU Cloud"
        ``` bash
        sudo /usr/share/wallarm-common/register-node -t <NODE_TOKEN> --force
        ```
    
    * `<NODE_TOKEN>` is the Wallarm node token.
    * The `--force` option forces rewriting of the Wallarm Cloud access credentials specified in the `/etc/wallarm/node.yaml` file.

## Step 9: Update the Wallarm blocking page

In new node version, the Wallarm sample blocking page has [been changed](what-is-new.md#new-blocking-page). The logo and support email on the page are now empty by default.

If the page `&/usr/share/nginx/html/wallarm_blocked.html` was configured to be returned in response to blocked requests, [copy and customize](../../admin-en/configuration-guides/configure-block-page-and-code.md#customizing-sample-blocking-page) the new version of a sample page.

## Step 10: Rename deprecated NGINX directives

Rename the following NGINX directives if they are explicitly specified in configuration files:

* `wallarm_instance` → [`wallarm_application`](../../admin-en/configure-parameters-en.md#wallarm_application)
* `wallarm_local_trainingset_path` → [`wallarm_custom_ruleset_path`](../../admin-en/configure-parameters-en.md#wallarm_custom_ruleset_path)
* `wallarm_global_trainingset_path` → [`wallarm_protondb_path`](../../admin-en/configure-parameters-en.md#wallarm_protondb_path)
* `wallarm_ts_request_memory_limit` → [`wallarm_general_ruleset_memory_limit`](../../admin-en/configure-parameters-en.md#wallarm_general_ruleset_memory_limit)

We only changed the names of the directives, their logic remains the same. Directives with former names will be deprecated soon, so you are recommended to rename them before.

## Step 11: Update the node logging variables

In the new node version the following changes to the [node logging variables](../../admin-en/configure-logging.md#filter-node-variables) have been implemented:

* The `wallarm_request_time` variable has been renamed to `wallarm_request_cpu_time`.

    We only changed the variable name, its logic remains the same. The old name is temporarily supported as well, but still it is recommended to rename the variable.
* The `wallarm_request_mono_time` variable has been added – place it in the configuration of the logging format if you need log information about total time being the sum of:

    * Time in the queue
    * Time in seconds the CPU spent processing the request

## Step 12: Adjust Wallarm node filtration mode settings to changes released in the latest versions

1. Ensure that the expected behavior of settings listed below corresponds to the [changed logic of the `off` and `monitoring` filtration modes](what-is-new.md#filtration-modes):
      * [Directive `wallarm_mode`](../../admin-en/configure-parameters-en.md#wallarm_mode)
      * [General filtration rule configured in Wallarm Console](../../user-guides/settings/general.md)
      * [Low-level filtration rules configured in Wallarm Console](../../user-guides/rules/wallarm-mode-rule.md)
2. If the expected behavior does not correspond to the changed filtration mode logic, please adjust the filtration mode settings to released changes using the [instructions](../../admin-en/configure-wallarm-mode.md).

## Step 13: Transfer the `overlimit_res` attack detection configuration from directives to the rule

--8<-- "../include/waf/upgrade/migrate-to-overlimit-rule-nginx.md"

## Step 14: Update the `wallarm-status.conf` file contents

Update the `/etc/nginx/conf.d/wallarm-status.conf` contents as follows:

```
server {
  listen 127.0.0.8:80;
  server_name localhost;

  allow 127.0.0.0/8;   # Access is only available for loopback addresses of the filter node server  
  deny all;

  wallarm_mode off;
  disable_acl "on";   # Checking request sources is disabled, denylisted IPs are allowed to request the wallarm-status service. https://docs.wallarm.com/admin-en/configure-parameters-en/#disable_acl
  access_log off;

  location ~/wallarm-status$ {
    wallarm_status on;
  }
}
```

[More details on the statistics service configuration](../../admin-en/configure-statistics-service.md)

## Step 15: Restart NGINX

--8<-- "../include/waf/restart-nginx-3.6.md"

## Step 16: Test Wallarm node operation

--8<-- "../include/waf/installation/test-after-node-type-upgrade.md"

## Step 17: Re-enable the Active threat verification module (only if upgrading node 2.16 or lower)

Learn the [recommendation on the Active threat verification module setup](../../vulnerability-detection/active-threat-verification/running-test-on-staging.md) and re-enable it if required.

After a while, ensure the module operation does not cause false positives. If discovering false positives, please contact the [Wallarm technical support](mailto:support@wallarm.com).

## Step 18: Delete the node of the previous version

Once the operation of the new node is properly tested, open the **Nodes** section of Wallarm Console and delete the regular node of the previous version from the list.

If the postanalytics module is installed on a separate server, please also delete the node instance related to this module.

## Settings customization

The Wallarm modules are updated to version 4.4. Previous filtering node settings will be applied to the new version automatically. To make additional settings, use the [available directives](../../admin-en/configure-parameters-en.md).

--8<-- "../include/waf/installation/common-customization-options-nginx-4.4.md"
