# Deploying Wallarm to AWS from AMI

Detailed instructions on deploying this solution.

We will re-factor the articles below (make the instructions shorter, probably combine them, take into account the notes shared by the Tim's team)

https://docs.wallarm.com/admin-en/installation-ami-en/
https://docs.wallarm.com/admin-en/installation-guides/amazon-cloud/create-image/

Notes:

1. We have the section explaining auto scaling configuration https://docs.wallarm.com/admin-en/installation-guides/amazon-cloud/autoscaling-overview/

    I think, in the current structure of docs, we should leave it in the AMI deployment docs.

    The same for GCP. Probably, the current aticles will be re-factored during implementation.
