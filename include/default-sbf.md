* **AI/LLM** (artificial intelligence/large language models) flows - requests/endpoints/parameters related to the systems that use ML models, neural networks, chatbots or systems that in turn access some paid third-party AI services, such as OpenAI.
* **Acc create** (account creation) and **Acc mgmt** (account management) flows - the key administrative flows relating to your applications.
* **Admin** (administrative) flows - requests/endpoints/parameters related to applications' administrative functions and activities. Such requests/endpoints/parameters are usually targeted by attackers in order to access functionality intended for privileged users only (BFLA), escalate privileges and gaining control over the system.
* **Auth** (authentication) flows - requests/endpoints/parameters critical to access control, as they verify user identity and manage permissions. As the entry point to the app, they are often the first target for attackers seeking to bypass security, gain unauthorized access, and take over accounts.
* **Billing** flows - sensitive due to usage and possible breach of critical personal financial data and susceptible to fraud.
* **SMS GW** (SMS gateway) flows - requests/endpoints/parameters sensitive because attackers can exploit them in SMS pumping attacks, flooding them with messages to inflate costs. Since these requests/endpoints/parameters are connected to API gateways and payment systems, this can lead to financial loss and system overload.
