Use Wallarm triggers to set up an additional alert to be sent when:

* Number of [attacks](../../../glossary-en.md#attack), [hits](../../../glossary-en.md#hit) or incidents per time interval (day, hour, etc.) exceeds the set number
* [Changes in API](../../../about-wallarm/api-discovery.md#tracking-changes-in-api) took place
* IP address was [denylisted](../../../user-guides/ip-lists/denylist.md)
* New user was added to the company account

For condition detailing, you can add one or more filters. As soon, as condition and filters are set, select the integration through which the selected alert should be sent. You can select several integrations simultaneously.
