Wallarm CDN node operates as a reverse proxy to the protected server. It analyzes incoming traffic, mitigates malicious requests and forwards legitimate requests to the protected server.

!!! warning "What can be protected with CDN node"
    With the CDN node you can protect the third-level (or lower, like 4th-, 5th- etc.) domains. For example, you can create CDN node for `ple.example.com`, but not for `example.com`.

As for the other characteristics of the Wallarm CDN node:

* Hosted by the third-party cloud provider (Section.io), so no resources are required from your infrastructure to deploy the CDN node.

    !!! info "Uploading request data to the third-party cloud provider"
        Some data on processed requests is uploaded to the Lumen service.
* Uploads some request data to the Wallarm Cloud. [Learn more about uploaded data and cutting the sensitive data][data-to-wallarm-cloud-docs]
* [Operates][operation-modes-docs] in the **safe blocking** mode relying on the [IP graylist contents][graylist-populating-docs] to identify suspected traffic and block it.

    To change the mode, use the corresponding [rule][operation-mode-rule-docs].
* The CDN node is fully configured via Wallarm Console UI. The only setting to be changed in another way is adding the Wallarm CNAME record to the protected resource's DNS records.
* You can request the [Wallarm support team](mailto:support@wallarm.com) to perform [application configuration][link-app-conf] for your node.
