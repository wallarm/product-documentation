!!! warning "Wallarm nodes 3.6 and lower are not supported"
    You are recommended to upgrade the Wallarm nodes 3.6 and lower since these versions are [not supported, they are end-of-life](../versioning-policy.md#version-list).

    Node configuration and traffic filtration have been significantly simplified in the Wallarm node of the latest versions. Before upgrading the modules, please carefully review the [list of changes](what-is-new.md) and [general recommendations](../general-recommendations.md). Please note that some settings of the latest node are **incompatible** with the nodes 3.6 and lower.
