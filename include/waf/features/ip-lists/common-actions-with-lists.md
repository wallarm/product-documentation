## Adding an object to the list

To add an IP address, subnet, or group of IP addresses to the list:

1. Click the **Add object** button.
2. Specify an IP address or group of IP addresses in one of the following ways:

    * Input a single **IP address** or a **subnet**
        
        !!! info "Supported subnet masks"
            Maximum supported subnet mask is `/32` for IPv6 addresses and `/12` for IPv4 addresses.
    
    * Select a **country** (geolocation) to add all IP addresses registered in this country
    * Select a **source** to add all IP addresses that belong to this source:
        * **Tor** for IP addresses of the Tor network
        * **Proxy** for IP addresses of public or web proxy servers
        * **VPN** for IP addresses of virtual private networks
        * **AWS** for IP addresses registered in Amazon AWS
        * **Azure** for IP addresses registered in Microsoft Azure
        * **GCP** for IP addresses registered in Google Cloud Platform
3. Select the period for which an IP address or a group of IP addresses should be added to the list. The minimum value is 5 minutes, the maximum value is forever.
4. Specify the reason for adding an IP address or a group of IP addresses to the list.
5. Confirm adding an IP address or a group of IP addresses to the list.

## Analyzing objects added to the list

The Wallarm Console displays the following data on each object added to the list:

* **Object** - IP address, subnet, country or IP source added to the list.
* **Application** - application to which access configuration of the object is applied. Since applying the [object access configuration to specific applications is limited](overview.md#known-caveats-of-ip-lists-configuration), this column always displays the value **All**.
* **Source** - source of a single IP address or subnet:
    * Country (geolocation) where a single IP address or subnet is registered
    * Data center where a single IP address or subnet is registered: **AWS** for Amazon, **GCP** for Google Cloud Platform, **Azure** for Microsoft Azure
    * **Tor** for IP address of the Tor network
    * **Proxy** for IP address of public or web proxy servers
    * **VPN** for IP addresses of virtual private networks
* **Reason** - reason for adding an IP address or a group of IP addresses to the list. The reason is manually specified when adding objects to the list or automatically generated when IPs are added to the list by [triggers](../triggers/triggers.md).
* **Adding date** - date and time when an object was added to the list.
* **Remove** - time period after which an object will be deleted from the list.

## Filtering the list

You can filter the objects in the list by:

* IP address or subnet specified in the search string
* Period for which you want to get a status of the list
* Country in which an IP address or a subnet is registered
* Source to which an IP address or a subnet belongs

## Changing the time that an object is on the list

To change the time that an IP address is on the list:

1. Select an object from the list.
2. In the selected object menu, click **Change time period**.
3. Select a new date for removing an object from the list and confirm the action.

## Deleting an object from the list

To delete an object from the list:

1. Select one or several objects from the list.
2. Click **Delete**.
