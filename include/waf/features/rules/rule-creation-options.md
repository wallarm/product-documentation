You can create and apply the rule both in the **Attacks** and **Rules** sections of Wallarm Console.

* In the **Attacks** section, rules are created with a pre-filled description of endpoints to apply the rule to. The endpoint description corresponds to the request you clicked the **Rule** button for.

    To complete the rule setup, just select the rule action type and make sure all rule components are configured correctly.
* In the **Rules** section, all rule components must be filled in manually.
