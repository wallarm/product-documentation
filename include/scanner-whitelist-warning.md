!!! warning "Disable Blocking of the Wallarm Scanner IP Addresses"
    Note that if you use the blocking mode by default (`default block;`) when detecting malicious requests, you must explicitly specify for the Wallarm scanner a list of IP addresses from which requests should not be blocked.

    You can read more about disabling the blocking mode for scanner IP addresses [here](scanner-ips-allowlisting.md).
