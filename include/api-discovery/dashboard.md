Review data about your API collected by the Wallarm's [**API Discovery**][apid-overview] with the **API Discovery** dashboard.

The dashboard provides the full landscape of your API endpoints, including total APIs, APIs by  discovered sensitive data, host and application. It visualizes the **risk score assessment** results helping prioritize security efforts by identifying the most vulnerable or high-risk APIs.

APIs evolve over time, with new endpoints being added and old ones deprecated. The dashboard provides visibility into these changes which ensures that deprecated APIs are properly retired and that new or modified APIs are compliant with security policies and standards.

Consider the following:

* How much your API endpoints are under risk is marked with the [risk score][apid-risk-score]
* Pay attention to [changes][apid-track-changes] in your API (displayed for the last 7 days)
* How many parameters hold the sensitive data and what types of data exactly is a valuable information
* You can analyze the number of found APIs by host and application

The elements of the dashboard are all interactive which means you can click the element to be redirected to API Discovery with corresponding filters: for example, click Medium Risk APIs and the API Discovery section will be opened displaying all APIs with this risk level.
