Review data about your API collected by the Wallarm's [**API Discovery**][apid-overview] with the **API Discovery** dashboard.

The dashboard provides the full landscape of your API endpoints, including shadow, orphan, and zombie APIs. It visualizes the **risk score assessment** results helping prioritize security efforts by identifying the most vulnerable or high-risk APIs.

APIs evolve over time, with new endpoints being added and old ones deprecated. The dashboard provides visibility into these changes which ensures that deprecated APIs are properly retired and that new or modified APIs are compliant with security policies and standards.

Consider the following:

* How much your API endpoints are under risk is marked with the [risk score][apid-risk-score]
* Pay attention to [changes][apid-track-changes] in your API (displayed for the last 7 days)
* [Rogue API][apid-rogue] is a serious risk factor - upload your specification to compare with real traffic
