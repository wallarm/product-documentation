* Rules are used to fine-tune Wallarm's [basic][link-attack-detection-tools] attack protection **while** mitigation controls extend this basic protection with additional security measures.
* Rules work [per-node][link-nodes] **while** mitigation controls work [per-session][link-sessions]. Consider the example: if you want to provide [brute force protection][link-brute-force-protection], you can create rule or mitigation control. Both of them will count the number of unique values seen for password holding parameter. But if you traffic goes through several filtering nodes, rule will count for each node independently, while mitigation control provide unified counter.
* Rules follow the [filtration mode][link-filtration-mode] **while** mitigation controls are capable of both following and contradicting it (and being prior) and even changing it.
* Rules are part of basic Cloud Native WAAP [subscription plan][link-sub-plans], **while** mitigation controls are only available in Advanced API Security plan.
